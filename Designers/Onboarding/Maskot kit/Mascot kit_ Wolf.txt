The following mascot kit provides a comprehensive framework for Mary the Office Wolf, following the established pattern from Sharky the Office Shark. This standardized approach ensures consistency across your mascot collection while maintaining unique environmental elements for each character.

Character Prompt Structure for AI Generation
Developing effective prompts for AI image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E requires specific language and formatting to achieve consistent, high-quality results. The images should show a well-executed 3D cartoon-style wolf character with anthropomorphic features, professional attire, and expressive features.

Base Character Prompt Template
For generating consistent mascot characters across your collection, utilize this standardized prompt structure:

3D cartoon [character type] mascot, anthropomorphic, [specific animal] with [distinctive feature], wearing [clothing description], [pose/action], [expression], [viewpoint], professional 3D rendering, solid [background color], character design, mascot logo --ar 1:1 --stylize 750

Character Consistency Requirements

Use the same technical specifications in AI prompts

Ensure similar level of detail and complexity

Apply consistent lighting and shading techniques

Environment Differentiation Strategy

Reflect the character's species and personality

Include the same categories (workspace essentials, environment elements, decorative items)
