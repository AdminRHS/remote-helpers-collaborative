Sharky the Office Shark: Mascot Kit Development Guide
The following mascot kit provides a comprehensive framework for Sharky the Office Shark and future character designs. This standardized approach ensures consistency across your planned 30-character mascot collection while maintaining unique environmental elements for each character.

Character Prompt Structure for AI Generation
Developing effective prompts for AI image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E requires specific language and formatting to achieve consistent, high-quality results. The images provided show a well-executed 3D cartoon-style shark character with anthropomorphic features, professional attire, and expressive features.

Base Character Prompt Template
For generating consistent mascot characters across your collection, utilize this standardized prompt structure:

This format creates standalone character renders with clean backgrounds for maximum adaptability. The specific styling parameters ensure consistency in the visual aesthetic across all mascots while allowing for individual character distinctions.
