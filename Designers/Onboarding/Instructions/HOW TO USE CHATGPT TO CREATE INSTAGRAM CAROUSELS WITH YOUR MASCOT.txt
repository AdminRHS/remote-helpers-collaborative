🧭 GUIDE: HOW TO USE CHATGPT TO CREATE INSTAGRAM CAROUSELS WITH YOUR MASCOT  
For creators, designers, or marketers working with a character and educational content  

📦 WHAT YOU’LL NEED  
✅ A text document (educational, guide, explainer, etc.)  
✅ A character design (3D mascot or illustrated figure)  
✅ (Optional) A theme or tone (e.g. fun, professional, Gen Z-friendly)  

🧑‍💻 YOUR TASK:  
You’ll ask ChatGPT to help you turn the doc + character into a series of social media posts.  
Use the instruction below — it’s what you will send to ChatGPT.  

📩 COPY & PASTE THIS INTO CHATGPT:  

You're a social media content strategist. I will give you:  
- A text document on a topic (e.g. an AI guide)  
- A 3D character design  
- (Optional) a target theme or audience  

I want you to create an Instagram carousel/story series that:  
1. Uses my character as the main host  
2. Breaks the text into post ideas with slide titles  
3. For each post, gives:  
   - Instagram-style caption  
   - Slide title  
   - Image generation prompt with:  
     - My character (same style every time)  
     - A creative environment fitting the message  
     - An action/pose  
     - A bold white title at the top  
     - 9:16 aspect ratio formatting  

🔄 The full series can be **up to 20 slides** if needed to deeply cover the topic.  

👋 The **last slide** should be an **outro**, **conclusion**, or the **mascot saying goodbye** or inviting the audience to comment, share, or follow.  

Ask me for:  
- The character reference or detailed description  
- The goal of the series if it’s not clear  

Keep mascot style consistent and scenes visually themed!
