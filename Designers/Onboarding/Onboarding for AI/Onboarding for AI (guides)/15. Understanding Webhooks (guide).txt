🔹 1. What is a Webhook and How Does It Work?
📌 Webhook Definition
A webhook is an automatic data transfer mechanism that sends information from one system to another in real time. Instead of manually requesting data, webhooks push data automatically when a specific event happens.
💡 Analogy:
✔ A webhook is like a text message notification – when someone sends you a message, you instantly receive it without checking manually.

📌 How Webhooks Work in Automation
1️⃣ Event Happens → A specific trigger occurs (e.g., a form is submitted).
2️⃣ Webhook Sends Data → The system instantly sends data to another app.
3️⃣ Action is Triggered → The receiving system processes the data and performs an action (e.g., AI sends an automatic email response).
 
💡 Example:
✔ Trigger: A user makes a purchase on an e-commerce site.
✔ Webhook: Sends order details to an AI-based inventory management system.
✔ Action: AI updates stock availability and notifies the warehouse.

🔹 2. How Webhooks Differ from API Requests
📌 Webhooks vs. API Requests: Key Differences
Feature	Webhook	API Request
How it Works	Automatically pushes data when an event occurs	System pulls data when requested
Speed	Real-time, instant updates	Requires frequent polling for updates
Trigger-Based?	Yes, triggered by an event	No, needs a manual or scheduled request
Best Use Case	Live notifications, real-time automation	Fetching data when needed
💡 Simple Analogy:
✔ A webhook is like a text message – when an event happens, you instantly get notified.
✔ An API request is like refreshing a webpage – you manually check for updates.
✅ When to Use Webhooks:
●	AI chatbots receiving real-time user inputs.
●	AI-based CRM updating customer data instantly.
●	Real-time fraud detection in AI-powered security systems.
✅ When to Use API Requests:
●	Fetching historical reports from an AI analytics tool.
●	Manually requesting customer data from a CRM.
●	Running AI model training based on a scheduled request.
