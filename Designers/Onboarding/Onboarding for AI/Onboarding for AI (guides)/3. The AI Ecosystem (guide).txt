🔹 3. Ethics & Responsible AI Usage
AI offers great benefits, but it also introduces challenges that must be carefully managed.
📌 1. AI Bias & Fairness
✔ AI can inherit biases from the data it is trained on, leading to discriminatory decisions.
✔ Example: Hiring AI tools may unintentionally favor certain demographics due to biased training data.
📌 2. AI & Privacy Concerns
✔ AI collects and analyzes user data, which raises privacy issues.
✔ Example: Facial recognition AI tracks individuals without consent.
📌 3. AI & Job Displacement
✔ AI automates repetitive jobs, creating concerns about employment loss.
✔ Solution: AI augments human work rather than replacing all jobs.
🔹 Responsible AI use means balancing automation with fairness, privacy, and human oversight.
