🔹 2. AI Tools vs. AI Agents: What’s the Difference?
Feature	AI Tool	AI Agent
Function	Focuses on a single task (e.g., writing, designing, or coding)	Handles multiple tasks and makes independent decisions
Automation	Requires user input for each task	Can autonomously execute a workflow
Decision-Making	Executes predefined actions	Uses AI reasoning to decide what actions to take
Example	Grammarly (corrects text errors)	Auto-GPT (creates and executes project plans autonomously)
🔹 AI Tools = Task-specific helpers
🔹 AI Agents = Autonomous systems that can perform complex, multi-step tasks
