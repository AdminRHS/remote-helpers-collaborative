👽 You’ve seen it in movies.
But General AI (AGI) isn’t real yet.

If it were? It would: 🧠 Learn like a human
⚙️ Do any task
💭 Think independently

AGI is the moonshot. Researchers are working on it, but we’re not there yet.

📲 Instagram Post 5: Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Nets
Caption:
💥 Confused by all the AI terms? Here’s a super simple breakdown:

1️⃣ Machine Learning (ML) – Learns from data
2️⃣ Deep Learning (DL) – Uses layered models (neural nets)
3️⃣ Neural Networks (NN) – Mimic the brain's structure

🎥 Netflix recommendations? DL.
👁️ Facebook face tags? NN.
📺 YouTube video picks? ML.
