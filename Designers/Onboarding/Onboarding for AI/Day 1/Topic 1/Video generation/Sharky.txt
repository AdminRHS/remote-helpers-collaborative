Prompt for creating a video character:

"Create a 5-10 second animated video featuring a character named Sharky, an office worker shark. Sharky is an anthropomorphic shark with a big, friendly smile, sharp teeth, blue skin, large expressive eyes, and a sturdy build. He is dressed in a beige short-sleeved shirt, blue cargo shorts with pockets, a brown belt, and brown boots. The shirt has a small logo on the left side of the chest (the logo is a simple circular badge with a coral design). Sharky’s appearance must exactly match the reference: blue skin, rounded body, large head with sharp teeth, and a friendly smile, with no changes to his facial features or clothing.

Sharky is in his underwater office, styled to resemble a coral reef. The office contains no futuristic objects, and all elements reflect a natural underwater environment: a desk made of coral branches, a chair made of seaweed, shelves with seashells, and papers made of algae. The color palette of the office is in warm tones—shades of coral, orange, pink, and sandy beige, with no blue colors used. The background of the office includes soft lighting that mimics sunlight filtering through water, with bubbles slowly rising.

In the video, Sharky stands near his desk, actively gesturing with his hands (for example, pointing to an imaginary board or raising one hand as if explaining something) and speaking, opening his mouth with a friendly smile. His movements are energetic yet smooth, emphasizing his approachable personality. Sharky says in English, with a cheerful tone: 'Hello, I’m Sharky, and I’ll introduce you to working with artificial intelligence!' He is introducing the viewer to the topic of artificial intelligence, as if conducting a lesson: he can hold a sheet of algae with the text 'AI' written on it or point to it. The animation should be smooth, with clear character movements, and must maintain consistency in Sharky’s appearance for use in a series of videos."
