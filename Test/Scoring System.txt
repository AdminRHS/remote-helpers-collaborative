Scoring System
I'll provide a detailed analysis of how to structure the scoring and assessment system for the Lead Generation onboarding program.
1. Daily Training Structure Analysis The 5-day training program maps to our task management system like this:
* Project Template = Full Training Program (100% total)
   * Each Day = Milestone Template (20% of total)
      * Daily Activities = Task Templates
         * Individual Exercises = Step Templates
            * Scoring Criteria = Checklist Items
2. Scoring Category Weightings The provided scoring breakdown fits our structure:

Gemini score structure 


Let's design a scoring system for your CRM Academy that effectively tracks user progress and competency.
Proposed Scoring System
1. Test Scores
* Points per question: Assign points to each question in a test.
* Percentage score: Calculate the percentage of correctly answered questions.
* Pass/fail threshold: Set a minimum percentage score for passing a test (e.g., 70%).
* Weighted scoring: Assign different weights to questions based on difficulty or importance.
2. Tool Proficiency
* Tool-specific score: Maintain a separate score for each tool.
* Scoring factors:
   * Number of topics related to the tool that the user has completed.
   * Average test score on those topics.
   * Number of tasks related to the tool that the user has completed.
   * Quality of completed tasks (based on edit count or other metrics).
* Proficiency levels: Define levels of proficiency (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced) based on score ranges.
3. Task Completion
* Task count: Track the number of tasks completed by the user for each topic or tool.
* Task status: Record the status of each task (e.g., pending, submitted, approved).
* Task quality:
   * Edit count: Track the number of edits required for a task to be approved.
   * Feedback score: Assign a score based on mentor/administrator feedback.
   * Timeliness: Consider task completion time relative to deadlines.
4. Overall Score
* Composite score: Calculate an overall score for each user, combining test scores, tool proficiency, and task completion metrics.
* Weighting: Adjust the weights of different components based on their importance.
* Ranking: Create a leaderboard or ranking system based on overall scores to foster competition and motivation.
Implementation Notes
* Database: Store scores and related data in the user_test_results, user_task_results, and potentially a new user_scores table.
* Calculation logic: Implement scoring calculations in your Laravel backend.
* API endpoints: Expose API endpoints for retrieving user scores and related data.
* Frontend display: Display scores and progress in the user profile and progress tracking sections of your Next.js frontend.
Example
* User completes a test with 8 out of 10 questions correct.
   * Test score: 80%
   * If the passing threshold is 70%, the user passes the test.
* User has completed 3 topics related to "Gmail" and has an average test score of 85% on those topics. They have also completed 2 tasks related to "Gmail" with an average of 2 edits per task.
   * Gmail proficiency score: Calculated based on these metrics, potentially falling into the "intermediate" level.
Additional Considerations
* Score decay: Implement a score decay mechanism where scores decrease over time if the user doesn't engage with the platform.
* Score normalization: Normalize scores across different topics or tools to ensure fairness.
* Score visualization: Use charts and graphs to visualize user scores and progress over time.
Remember to tailor the scoring system to your specific needs and priorities. Regularly review and adjust the system based on user feedback and performance data.
To further enhance the scoring system and motivate users, let's explore additional parameters and achievement-based awards.
Additional Scoring Parameters
1. Consistency:
   * Daily/weekly streak: Award points for consecutive days/weeks of activity on the platform.
   * Completion rate: Track the percentage of assigned courses/topics completed within a given timeframe.
2. Engagement:
   * Forum participation: Award points for active participation in discussion forums related to courses/topics.
   * Content contribution: Award points for creating helpful resources (e.g., guides, tutorials) shared with other users.
   * Feedback quality: Award points for providing constructive feedback on courses, tests, or tasks.
3. Speed and Efficiency:
   * Task completion time: Award points for completing tasks within or ahead of schedule.
   * Test completion time: Award points for completing tests quickly and accurately.
   * First-time pass rate: Award points for passing tests or completing tasks on the first attempt.
Achievement-Based Awards
1. Badges:
   * Completion badges: Awarded for completing specific courses or learning paths.
   * Proficiency badges: Awarded for achieving certain levels of proficiency in tools or skills.
   * Engagement badges: Awarded for active participation and contributions to the learning community.
   * Challenge badges: Awarded for completing challenging tasks or tests.
2. Points and Levels:
   * Award points for various achievements (e.g., completing courses, passing tests, contributing content).
   * Define levels based on point accumulation (e.g., bronze, silver, gold).
   * Display user levels and progress towards the next level.
3. Leaderboards:
   * Create leaderboards based on overall scores or specific achievements.
   * Display user rankings and progress over time.
   * Offer rewards or recognition for top performers.
Implementation Notes
* Database: Store achievement data in new tables (e.g., user_achievements, user_badges).
* Calculation logic: Implement award and achievement calculation logic in your Laravel backend.
* API endpoints: Expose API endpoints for retrieving achievement data.
* Frontend display: Display badges, points, levels, and leaderboards in the user profile and progress tracking sections of your Next.js frontend.
Remember
* Tailor the awards and achievements to your specific goals and user motivations.
* Regularly review and update the system to keep users engaged and motivated.
* Consider offering tangible rewards (e.g., gift cards, company swag) for top performers.




Claude score structure 


I've created a comprehensive scoring system with a visualization dashboard. Let me explain each component and the scoring logic:
1. Test Score Calculation (0-100%):
sql
Copy
WITH test_results AS (
  SELECT 
    s.id as step_id,
    t.id as task_id,
    t.title,
    COUNT(c.id) as total_checklists,
    SUM(CASE WHEN c.is_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_checklists
  FROM steps s
  JOIN tasks t ON s.task_id = t.id
  LEFT JOIN checklists c ON s.id = c.step_id
  GROUP BY s.id, t.id, t.title
)
SELECT
  task_id,
  title,
  (completed_checklists * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_checklists, 0)) as score
FROM test_results;
2. Tool Proficiency Score (0-100%):
sql
Copy
WITH tool_usage AS (
  SELECT 
    t.tool_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) as total_tasks,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN t.is_completed = 1 THEN t.id END) as completed_tasks,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ep.id IS NOT NULL THEN t.id END) as tasks_with_edits
  FROM tasks t
  LEFT JOIN edits_progress ep ON t.id = ep.progressable_id 
    AND ep.progressable_type = 'task'
  WHERE t.tool_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY t.tool_id
)
SELECT
  tool_id,
  ((completed_tasks * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_tasks, 0)) * 
   (1 - (tasks_with_edits * 0.1))) as proficiency_score
FROM tool_usage;
3. Task Completion Tracking:
sql
Copy
WITH milestone_progress AS (
  SELECT 
    m.id as milestone_id,
    m.name as milestone_name,
    COUNT(t.id) as total_tasks,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.is_completed = 1 THEN 1 END) as completed_tasks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.is_completed = 1 THEN t.total_time ELSE 0 END) as total_time_spent
  FROM milestones m
  LEFT JOIN tasks t ON m.id = t.milestone_id
  GROUP BY m.id, m.name
)
SELECT
  milestone_id,
  milestone_name,
  (completed_tasks * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_tasks, 0)) as completion_percentage,
  total_time_spent
FROM milestone_progress;
4. Quality Metrics:
sql
Copy
WITH task_quality AS (
  SELECT 
    t.id as task_id,
    t.title,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ep.id) as edit_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tr.id) as result_count
  FROM tasks t
  LEFT JOIN edits_progress ep ON t.id = ep.progressable_id 
    AND ep.progressable_type = 'task'
  LEFT JOIN task_results tr ON t.id = tr.task_id
  GROUP BY t.id, t.title
)
SELECT
  task_id,
  title,
  CASE 
    WHEN edit_count = 0 AND result_count > 0 THEN 100
    WHEN edit_count > 0 THEN GREATEST(0, 100 - (edit_count * 5))
    ELSE 0
  END as quality_score
FROM task_quality;
Key Features of the Scoring System:
1. Test Scores:
* Each step in a task represents a test question
* Correct answers are tracked through completed checklists
* Final score is weighted based on question difficulty (can be stored in step_templates.hours_planned)
2. Tool Proficiency:
* Tracks completion of tasks related to specific tools
* Considers task complexity (based on task_templates.cost)
* Factors in edits received for tool-related tasks
* Progressive scoring based on advanced tool features mastered
3. Task Completion:
* Tracks progress through onboarding milestones
* Considers task dependencies through parent_task relationships
* Measures completion time against expected_hours
* Weighs mandatory vs optional tasks differently
4. Quality Metrics:
* Tracks edits received on completed tasks
* Measures time spent vs expected time
* Considers task complexity when weighing quality
* Tracks successful implementation through task_results
The dashboard visualizes these metrics using:
* Line charts for progress over time
* Radar charts for tool proficiency
* Progress bars for milestone completion
* Quality indicators for task performance
To implement this system, you'll need to:
1. Create indexes for performance:
sql
Copy
CREATE INDEX idx_steps_task_id ON steps(task_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_checklists_step_id ON checklists(step_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_milestone_id ON tasks(milestone_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_edits_progress_task ON edits_progress(progressable_id, progressable_type);
2. Set up triggers to update scores:
sql
Copy
CREATE TRIGGER update_task_score AFTER UPDATE ON checklists
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- Update related task scores
END;
3. Add constraints to ensure data integrity:
sql
Copy
ALTER TABLE steps ADD CONSTRAINT valid_checklist_count 
CHECK (
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checklists WHERE step_id = id) > 0
);
Would you like me to provide more specific implementation details for any part of this scoring system?
First, let's add the necessary database tables:
sql
Copy

    AVG(CASE WHEN tr.task_resultable_type = 'test' 
        THEN tr.score ELSE NULL END) * 0.3 as test_score,
    
    -- Task completion (30%)
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN t.is_completed = 1

  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN tasks t ON u.id = t.created_by
  LEFT JOIN task_results tr ON t.id = tr.task_id
  LEFT JOIN user_skills us ON u.id = us.user_id
  LEFT JOIN user_activity_streaks uas ON u.id = uas.user_id
  GROUP BY u.id

CREATE TRIGGER check_achievements AFTER UPDATE ON user_scores
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Check for speed achievements
    IF NEW.score_type = 'speed' AND NEW.points >= 100 THEN
        INSERT INTO user_achievements (user_id, achievement_id, unlocked_at)
        SELECT NEW.user_id, a.id, NOW()
        FROM achievements a
