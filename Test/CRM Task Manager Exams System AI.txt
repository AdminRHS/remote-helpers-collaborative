Expanded CRM System Structure
Your CRM includes multiple interconnected modules, and Checklists, Project Checklists, and Task Automation play a crucial role in your workflows.
________________


1. Checklist & Task Tracking System
The checklists module ensures structured workflows, task completion tracking, and quality control.
Key Tables:
* checklists – Main checklist entity, tracking each checklist item’s completion status.
* checklist_items – Individual checklist steps assigned to users or teams.
* checklist_item_guide – Links checklist items with relevant guides/documentation.
* task_templates – Predefined task structures used in workflows.
* task_request – Requests for new tasks that require approval or processing.
* task_request_assignee – Links specific users with task requests.
* task_results – Stores the output/result of tasks for tracking performance.
Workflow:
1. Checklist Creation – Tasks are broken down into checklist items that must be completed sequentially or in parallel.
2. Assignment – Each checklist item is assigned to a user, team, or tool.
3. Progress Tracking – As items are completed, they update their status (is_completed field).
4. Validation – Some items require validation via checklist_item_guide, ensuring they meet quality control standards.
5. Completion & Logging – Checklist completions are logged and linked to task_results for analytics.

2. Project-Based Checklists
Your project execution and milestone tracking integrate closely with checklists.
Key Tables:
* projects – Main entity tracking active projects.
* project_task – Links tasks with projects.
* project_templates – Predefined templates for structured project execution.
* milestone_templates – Defines key checkpoints/milestones in projects.
* milestone_template_task_template – Links milestones to specific tasks.
* project_temp_task_temp – Manages the project-template-to-task-template relationship.
Workflow:
1. Project Creation – A new project is created using a template.
2. Milestone Definition – The system sets up milestones from milestone_templates.
3. Task Assignment – Tasks are assigned to users, teams, or AI-driven automation.
4. Checklist Integration – Each milestone may have checklists for sub-tasks.
5. Progress Reporting – Completed checklists and tasks update status reports.

3. Automated Workflow Execution
Your CRM automates task tracking, checklist validation, and milestone completion.
Automation Components:
* step_templates – Predefined steps in a process.
* task_template_step_template – Links task templates with required steps.
* steps – Tracks actual step execution within tasks.
* step_tracker – Logs user interaction with steps.
* step_template_checklist_item – Ensures checklists are integrated into steps.
Workflow:
1. Task Assigned → Step Execution Starts.
2. Checklist Items Marked as Completed.
3. Milestones Reached → Reports Updated.
4. System Logs User Activity in step_tracker.

4. Reporting & Analytics
Tracking performance and automating feedback loops is key.
Key Tables:
* report_dailies – Daily logs of activities.
* report_countries – Country-specific recruitment and business activity reports.
* report_languages – Reports categorized by languages.
* status_entities_blocks – Logs the status of checklist items, tasks, and milestones.
