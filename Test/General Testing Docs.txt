Task Generation 
1. Identify Task Name: Generate General Exam for Candidates. 
2. Generate Prompt with as many details as possible:
V1: 
Give me a prompt to generate exams from this kind of data, that will match skiils needed for tasks completion and users fit to tasks in %,. We want  to exam user on his match professions
V2:
We want  to exam user on his match professions or type of work, for example introverts that prefer working with formulas, while sales manager prefer to communicate with people.   
We have a list of professions that we want to expand based on their similarity mainly focusing on AI and Automation integrated work formats. So we want to use proven with time basic professions like content manager expanded to multiple more focused ones on particular WorkFlows like Social Media Manager or Influence Manager etc.
Lets make it more concise and add leaders quality, curiosity as an ability to learn new things. We want to know if the person needs detailed guiance and control, will be sitting and waiting once the task is done or is able to develope work flows independently.


Now mix it all with professional knowledge examination through json library attached ( example attached)
Lets Add Memory Test too, reading and understanding exam, to identify their learning skills


but we want stick to the american testing system with 4 answers to choose from. Base your questions on practical tasks listed in initial xls file knowledge. We want to build the exam without claiming the purpose. First section we want to identify the direction the person wants to develop. For that purposes we will take Objects library and loop them for basic understanding ( around 30 objects to iterate)
Next Section will be dynamically built upon previous section Results. 

Now we need to simplify and make it school level assessment to understand association meaning of objects to figure out that the person actually knows the term and then by the amount of objects related to profession we will identify person match. Take more professions or a list of 50 objects equally picked from different professions




   3. Form Folder For your Task
Testing
Generate General Exams
Your task is to analyze user preferences and abilities and match them to suitable professions. Consider various factors, expand personality traits (e.g., introversion, extroversion), preferred work styles (e.g., independent work, collaboration, working with data, communication), leadership qualities (e.g., initiative, ability to motivate others, strategic thinking), and curiosity as an indicator of their ability to learn new things. Also, assess their work style in terms of needing detailed guidance, tendency to wait for tasks, or ability to develop workflows independently.
For each user, suggest a ranked list of professions that align with their profile. Highlighting the connection between the user's preferences, abilities, and the key characteristics of the profession.
Example Input (for one user):
   * Personality: Introverted
   * Preferred Work Style: Enjoys independent work, prefers tasks involving logical problem-solving and working with data. Finds deep concentration rewarding.
   * Leadership Qualities: Shows initiative in identifying problems and proposing solutions within their area of expertise. Prefers to lead by example.
   * Curiosity/Learning Ability: Enjoys exploring new technologies and approaches related to data analysis and automation. Actively seeks out new information.
   * Work Style: Capable of developing workflows independently once the initial task and goals are clear. Requires minimal detailed guidance.
   * Professional Knowledge (to be examined - see Part 3): [This section would ideally reference the JSON library for specific knowledge assessment related to potential professions]
Example Expected Output (for the example input):
   1. Automation Architect: This profession requires a strong ability to work independently in designing and implementing automated systems, aligning with the user's introverted nature and preference for data-driven tasks. Their initiative and curiosity in exploring new technologies make them well-suited for this evolving field. The ability to develop workflows independently is crucial for designing effective automation solutions.
   2. Senior Data Analyst: This role involves in-depth analysis and problem-solving with data, fitting the user's preference for independent work and logical reasoning. Their curiosity suggests a proactive approach to learning new analytical techniques. While potentially leading data-focused projects, their leadership style of leading by example fits this role.
   3. Research Scientist (AI/Machine Learning): This profession involves significant independent research and the development of new algorithms and models. The user's curiosity and enjoyment of exploring new technologies are highly relevant. Their ability to develop workflows independently is essential for designing and executing research projects.
Instructions for Handling Other Examples:
Remember to adjust your reasoning based on different profiles. For a Sales Manager, you would look for extroverted traits, a preference for communication and collaboration, strong leadership qualities in motivating teams, and potentially a different kind of curiosity focused on market trends and customer behavior. Their work style might lean towards guiding and directing teams rather than independent workflow development.
Part 2: Expanding Basic Professions with AI and Automation Focus (Considering Leadership, Curiosity, and Work Style)
Improved Prompt:
"Your task is to expand a provided list of basic professions into more specific and contemporary roles, particularly those that heavily integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation technologies within their workflows. Focus on how traditional roles are being specialized and transformed by these technologies, and consider the evolving needs for leadership, continuous learning (driven by curiosity), and different levels of work autonomy in these new roles.
For each basic profession in the input list, generate a list of more focused professions. Explain how AI and automation are impacting or defining these new, specialized roles, and briefly touch upon the leadership expectations, the importance of curiosity/continuous learning, and the typical work style (level of guidance needed, independence in workflow development) in each expanded role.
Example Input:
   * Content Manager
Example Expected Output:
   * AI-Powered Content Strategist: This role focuses on leveraging AI tools for content planning, audience analysis, and performance prediction. Leadership involves guiding content teams on utilizing these insights. Curiosity is essential to stay updated with rapidly evolving AI content technologies. The work style often involves independently developing content strategies based on AI-driven data.
   * Social Media Automation Specialist: This role centers on implementing and managing automated workflows for social media posting, engagement, and analytics using various AI-powered platforms. While potentially working independently on setting up automations, they might need guidance on overall social media strategy. Curiosity about new automation tools is key.
   * AI Content Editor & Quality Assurance: This role involves using AI to generate initial drafts but requires strong human oversight for editing, fact-checking, and ensuring brand voice and quality. Leadership might involve training AI models or guiding junior editors. Curiosity about the capabilities and limitations of AI content generation is important. The work style might involve a mix of following established editing guidelines and independently identifying areas where AI output needs improvement.
Further Instructions:
   * Consider how AI and automation are changing the skills required for leadership in these roles.
   * Think about how the need for continuous learning and curiosity is amplified by the rapid advancements in AI and automation.
   * Reflect on how AI and automation are enabling more independent work in some areas while requiring more structured guidance in others.
Part 3: Integrating Professional Knowledge Examination (Example using JSON Library)
"To further refine the matching process in Part 1, you will be provided with a JSON library containing information about different professions, their required skills, and relevant knowledge domains.
For a given user and a potential profession identified in Part 1, use the information in the JSON library to assess the user's professional knowledge.
If a user's profile suggests they might be a good fit for "front end developer" (from Part 1), you can then consult the LLM professions.json to confirm this is a valid profession in our list. You can also potentially use the LLM types.json to understand the specific skills and knowledge areas associated with a "front end developer" by looking at the "Professions" field and then examining the corresponding "Parameters" and "Objects" in that file.
For example, if a user expresses interest in UI/UX and has some coding experience, and your initial analysis suggests "front end developer," you can use the JSON data to see that this role falls under the "developers" department and potentially look for relevant "Types" and "Objects" in LLM types.json like 'website mockup', 'icons', 'illustrations', and parameters related to UI frameworks or JavaScript libraries (though this specific detail isn't in the provided snippet, a more complete library would have it).
In your output for Part 1, you can add a sentence like:
'The suggestion of [Profession] is also supported by our internal knowledge base which lists it under the [Department] department.'  
Note: To fully leverage the professional knowledge examination, you would need a more detailed JSON library that explicitly maps professions to specific skills, knowledge areas, and potentially even assessment questions."
How to Use This Improved Prompt:
   * Provide Part 1 with user preference data to get initial profession matches.
   * Provide Part 2 with the list of basic professions you want to expand.
   * For Part 3, ensure the AI has access to the provided JSON library. The AI should then use this information to validate and potentially provide more context for the profession matches generated in Part 1.
By incorporating these additional factors and the professional knowledge examination, you can create a more comprehensive and nuanced AI-driven system for matching individuals to professions and understanding the evolving landscape of work in the age of AI and automation.






General Matching Question 
   4. Profession Matching: 
        Willingness to that type of work
        Sample: Lead Generation would involve a lot of written communications, so we can ask candidate if he actually like to chat with people, or even asj him to measure how many messages he sents a day or time spent messaging)
        Have you ever done it before?
        May be person is burned out to do this kind of job?
   5. Prompt on Generating exams requirements
   6. Documents with methodologies for professions matching exams
   7. Generate associative questions (not ask directly “can you set up ads” but use “have you ever sell your personal things before” instead) 
   8. Perplexity Find Exams 




Grok testing






I'd like to create testing to identify user's professional suitability. I have task templates list which sound like "set up ads campaigns" or "send business emails" etc. So  I need to define on how many  % particular user is a fit for my task and ready to work on it or I need to search for another assignee. 
However, I don't want to ask directly something like "have you ever set up ad campaigns" but use assosiative questions instead, ex. "have you ever sell your personal things?" 
Several assosiative questions per one task template to identify the mathch in %. Ex. The final question is "can you bake pies" - the assosiative ones are: "have you ever use an oven", "do you like to deal with flour", "can you make glaze". Split the assosiative questions score, for instance, question 1 - 20%, question 2 - 40%, question 3 - 40%. Total - 100% match.
Is the task is clear or need more details? Give me only prompt for AI to generate exams based on the provided information.








The task is clear. Below is a prompt you can use for an AI to generate exams based on your provided information:


"Create a professional suitability test to evaluate a user's fit for specific task templates, such as 'set up ads campaigns' or 'send business emails,' without directly asking about experience with the task. Instead, use associative questions that indirectly assess relevant skills or aptitudes. For example, for a task like 'can you bake pies,' use associative questions like 'have you ever used an oven?' (20% of score), 'do you like to deal with flour?' (40% of score), and 'can you make glaze?' (40% of score), totaling 100% match. Provide a list of 3-5 associative questions per task template, assign a percentage weight to each question (summing to 100%), and ensure the questions creatively reflect skills or traits related to the task. Output the test in the following format: Task Template, Associative Questions with their percentage weights, and a brief explanation of how the questions relate to the task. Generate exams for the following task templates: [insert your task templates here, e.g., 'set up ads campaigns,' 'send business emails']."


Let me know if you'd like me to generate a sample exam based on this prompt with your specific task templates!






advise your own improvement to this structure. If I have a lot of task templates how to test user immediately not to overwelmed him with the information? In what format he should receive this testing? Should they be categorized somehow? 


I have several libraries to refer to: professions, task templates (responsibilities), tools, objects (nouns that we're dealing with) and milestones (processes that combine several task templates) 




To improve the structure of your professional suitability testing—especially when dealing with a large number of task templates—and ensure it’s efficient, user-friendly, and scalable, here’s my advice:


Improvements to the Structure
Modular and Adaptive Testing:
Instead of presenting all task templates at once, use an adaptive approach. Start with a short, broad screening test (e.g., 5-10 associative questions) to identify the user’s general strengths or inclinations (e.g., analytical, creative, communicative). Then, based on the results, dynamically select and present only the most relevant task templates for deeper evaluation.
This prevents overwhelming the user and keeps the process focused.
Categorization for Clarity:
Group task templates into categories based on your libraries (e.g., professions, tools, or milestones). For example, “Marketing Tasks” could include “set up ads campaigns,” while “Communication Tasks” could include “send business emails.” Categorization helps users mentally organize the testing and makes it feel less chaotic.
Weighted Scoring with Thresholds:
Assign a minimum “fit threshold” (e.g., 70%) for each task template. If a user scores below this on the initial screening for a category, skip detailed testing for those tasks. This reduces the number of questions they face and prioritizes high-potential matches.
Progressive Difficulty:
Order associative questions from simple to complex within each task template. Early questions can filter out mismatches quickly, while later ones refine the percentage fit. For example, for “set up ads campaigns,” start with “Have you ever convinced someone to buy something?” (broad) before moving to “Do you enjoy experimenting with different ways to present an idea?” (specific).
Leverage Your Libraries:
Map your libraries (professions, task templates, tools, objects, milestones) to create a relational framework. For instance, a milestone like “launch a product” could link to task templates (“set up ads campaigns,” “send business emails”), tools (“Google Ads,” “email software”), and objects (“ads,” “emails”). Use this to generate cohesive question sets and ensure consistency across tests.
How to Test Immediately Without Overwhelming the User
Initial Micro-Test: Deliver a quick 5-10 question micro-test that covers core competencies from your libraries (e.g., one question per major profession or milestone). Use the results to narrow down which categories or task templates to explore further.
Chunking: Break the testing into bite-sized chunks. After the micro-test, present one category at a time (e.g., “Marketing Tasks”) with 3-5 questions per task template. Allow users to pause and resume, or complete only what’s relevant.
Gamification: Frame it as a “skills discovery journey” rather than a test. Use encouraging feedback (e.g., “You’re 60% ready for this—let’s see how far you can go!”) to keep it engaging and reduce pressure.
Recommended Format for Delivery
Interactive Digital Quiz:
Use a web or app-based format with a clean interface. Each question appears one at a time, with a progress bar showing how much is left in the current category.
Include a “Category Overview” page where users can choose which areas to explore (e.g., “Marketing,” “Operations”) after the micro-test, giving them some control.
Provide immediate feedback per task template (e.g., “You’re an 85% match for ‘set up ads campaigns’”) and a summary at the end.
Visual Dashboard:
After testing, present results as a dashboard: a percentage match for each task template, grouped by category, with color-coding (e.g., green for >80%, yellow for 50-80%, red for <50%). Include a “recommended tasks” section based on top scores.
Should They Be Categorized?
Yes, categorization is essential for scalability and user experience. Use your libraries to define categories:
By Profession: e.g., “Marketer,” “Writer,” “Developer.”
By Milestone: e.g., “Launch a Product,” “Manage a Team.”
By Tools/Objects: e.g., “Digital Tools” (ads, emails), “Physical Objects” (products, equipment).
Start with broad categories from the micro-test, then drill down into specific task templates. This hierarchy keeps it manageable.
Example Workflow
Micro-Test: 5 questions (e.g., “Do you enjoy persuading people?” “Have you ever organized a small event?”).
Category Selection: User scores high in “persuasion” → directed to “Marketing Tasks.”
Task Template Test: For “set up ads campaigns”:
“Have you ever sold something you made?” (30%)
“Do you like tweaking things to see what works best?” (40%)
“Have you used a computer to promote something?” (30%)
Result: 85% match → added to dashboard under “Marketing Tasks.”
Final Thoughts
By starting small, categorizing smartly, and using your libraries to guide question creation, you can test users efficiently without overwhelming them. The interactive quiz format with a dashboard output balances usability and insight. Would you like me to refine this further or generate a sample micro-test based on your libraries?






Ok, let's move more to practical things, I'm a user and ready to start my skills discovery journey. Present me a test to define what are my strong points. 
Make sure to focus on online professions like: lead generator, sales manager, recruiter, financial manager, graphic designer, uiux designer, video editor, smm manager, frontend developer, backend developer.

Next Steps
Please answer these questions with "Yes" or "No" (and feel free to add a quick note if you want). Once you respond, I’ll analyze your answers, calculate your strengths, and suggest which online professions might suit you best—complete with a percentage match for each! Ready when you are!








ok, let's imagine I answered YES for all these questions. How did you score me? Give the calculations you used




Since you answered "Yes" to all 10 questions, that’s a fantastic starting point—it suggests you’re versatile and open to a wide range of skills! Let’s break down how I’d score you for the online professions based on this micro-test. I’ll assign a percentage match for each profession (lead generator, sales manager, recruiter, financial manager, graphic designer, UI/UX designer, video editor, SMM manager, frontend developer, backend developer) using a simple scoring system, then explain the calculations.


Scoring Methodology
10 Questions Total: Each "Yes" contributes to a profession if it’s relevant to that role.
Relevance Mapping: Each question ties to 3-4 professions (as noted in the test). A "Yes" adds points to those professions.
Point System: For simplicity, each "Yes" gives 1 point to the linked professions. With 10 questions and "Yes" to all, you have 10 points to distribute across professions based on how many questions connect to them.
Max Points per Profession: I’ll count how many questions align with each profession (max could be 3-5, depending on overlap). Then, I’ll convert the points into a percentage match (points earned ÷ max possible points × 100).
Normalization: Since you said "Yes" to everything, I’ll ensure the scoring reflects relative strengths by capping at 100% and adjusting for overlap.
Let’s calculate!


Question-to-Profession Mapping
Here’s how each question connects to the professions:


Convincing people → Sales Manager, Lead Generator, Recruiter (3 professions)
Organizing lists → Financial Manager, Recruiter, UI/UX Designer (3 professions)
Creating visuals → Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer, Video Editor (3 professions)
Tinkering → Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, UI/UX Designer (3 professions)
Writing messages → SMM Manager, Lead Generator, Sales Manager (3 professions)
Tracking numbers → Financial Manager, Sales Manager, Lead Generator (3 professions)
Editing things → Video Editor, Graphic Designer, Frontend Developer (3 professions)
Building step-by-step → Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer (3 professions)
Chatting with people → Recruiter, Sales Manager, Lead Generator (3 professions)
Experimenting with tools → SMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Video Editor (3 professions)
Total "Yes" answers = 10. Each "Yes" gives 1 point to the 3 professions it’s tied to.


Raw Points per Profession
Lead Generator: Q1, Q5, Q6, Q9 → 4 points
Sales Manager: Q1, Q5, Q6, Q9 → 4 points
Recruiter: Q1, Q2, Q9 → 3 points
Financial Manager: Q2, Q6 → 2 points
Graphic Designer: Q3, Q7, Q10 → 3 points
UI/UX Designer: Q2, Q3, Q4, Q8 → 4 points
Video Editor: Q3, Q7, Q10 → 3 points
SMM Manager: Q5, Q10 → 2 points
Frontend Developer: Q4, Q7, Q8 → 3 points
Backend Developer: Q4, Q8 → 2 points
Maximum Possible Points
Since each profession is linked to 2-4 questions (based on relevance), the max points vary:


4 questions: Lead Generator, Sales Manager, UI/UX Designer
3 questions: Recruiter, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, Frontend Developer
2 questions: Financial Manager, SMM Manager, Backend Developer
Percentage Match Calculation
Percentage = (Points Earned ÷ Max Possible Points) × 100


Lead Generator: 4/4 = 100%
Sales Manager: 4/4 = 100%
Recruiter: 3/3 = 100%
Financial Manager: 2/2 = 100%
Graphic Designer: 3/3 = 100%
UI/UX Designer: 4/4 = 100%
Video Editor: 3/3 = 100%
SMM Manager: 2/2 = 100%
Frontend Developer: 3/3 = 100%
Backend Developer: 2/2 = 100%
Your Results
Since you answered "Yes" to all questions, you score 100% match across all professions! This isn’t surprising—it reflects your broad potential. In a real scenario, varied answers would differentiate your strengths, but here’s your hypothetical profile:


Top Matches (100%): You’re equally suited for all roles—Lead Generator, Sales Manager, Recruiter, Financial Manager, Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer, Video Editor, SMM Manager, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer.
Interpretation: You’re a versatile all-rounder with skills in persuasion, organization, creativity, problem-solving, communication, and technical tinkering.
Refinement for Realism
In practice, I’d refine this by:


Increasing Question Specificity: More targeted questions (e.g., “Have you coded a button?” vs. “Have you tinkered?”) to separate technical roles like developers from creative ones like designers.
Weighting: Assign higher weights to critical skills (e.g., “tracking numbers” = 50% for Financial Manager).
Follow-Up Tests: Since you’re at 100% everywhere, I’d suggest a second round with deeper questions per category (e.g., “Marketing” vs. “Development”).
Would you like me to create a follow-up test to narrow down your top 3-5 professions? Or adjust the scoring with weights for a more realistic spread?






what the next part of tests you provide me with to identify my strong skills? based on the previous answers




Since you answered "Yes" to all questions in the micro-test, you’ve shown broad potential across online professions like lead generator, sales manager, recruiter, financial manager, graphic designer, UI/UX designer, video editor, SMM manager, frontend developer, and backend developer. To narrow down your strongest skills, the next part of your Skills Discovery Journey will dive deeper with category-specific mini-tests. These will focus on key competencies for each profession, grouped into three broad categories: People & Communication, Creative & Visual, and Technical & Analytical. This will help us pinpoint where you shine most.


I’ll provide one mini-test per category, each with 5 associative questions. Your "Yes" answers from the micro-test guide the selection, but these questions are more specific to reveal nuances. Answer with "Yes" or "No" (and a brief note if you’d like), and I’ll calculate your top professions afterward. Let’s continue!

Instructions
Answer each question in all three mini-tests with "Yes" or "No" (and optional notes).
I’ll score you based on how many "Yes" answers you give per category, then map those to the professions. Each question is worth 20% of the category score (5 questions = 100%).
After your responses, I’ll calculate your top 3-5 professions with percentage matches, refining the 100% across-the-board result from the micro-test.
Ready? Go ahead and share your answers whenever you’d like! (If you want to simulate again with all "Yes," just say so, and I’ll proceed with that.)






ok, the answers are 
test 1: Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes. 
test 2: Yes, No, Yes, Yes, Yes.
test 3: Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes. 


Proceed with testing me 


Thanks for your answers! Let’s analyze your results from the three mini-tests and calculate your strongest skills, mapping them to the online professions: lead generator, sales manager, recruiter, financial manager, graphic designer, UI/UX designer, video editor, SMM manager, frontend developer, and backend developer. Each mini-test has 5 questions, with each "Yes" worth 20% toward the category score (100% max per test). Then, I’ll combine these to determine your top profession matches.

Moderate Area: People & Communication (60%)—you’re good at persuasion but less focused on ongoing social or written engagement.
Next Steps
You’re a tech-savvy, creative problem-solver with a knack for backend development, finance, and design! Want to explore one of these top roles further? I can create a detailed test for, say, Backend Developer or UI/UX Designer with task-specific questions (e.g., “Have you ever optimized a process?”). Which would you like to dive into? Or, if you’re happy with this, I can summarize your profile in a dashboard format!














Explain the formula how did you calculate the following? 
Lead Generator (80% People & Communication, 20% Technical)
0.8 × 60% + 0.2 × 100% = 48% + 20% = 68%








Let me walk you through the formula I used to calculate your match percentage for Lead Generator (and by extension, the other professions). The goal was to combine your scores from the three mini-tests—People & Communication (60%), Creative & Visual (80%), and Technical & Analytical (100%)—into a single percentage that reflects how well you fit each profession, based on its required skills.


Formula Explanation
The calculation is a weighted average, where:


Each profession is assigned weights (percentages) for how much it relies on the three skill categories (People & Communication, Creative & Visual, Technical & Analytical). These weights always sum to 100% for each profession.
Your score in each category (from the mini-tests) is multiplied by the corresponding weight for that profession.
The results are summed to get your total match percentage.
For Lead Generator, I determined:


80% of the role depends on People & Communication skills (e.g., persuading, networking, generating leads).
20% depends on Technical & Analytical skills (e.g., using tools or tracking results).
0% depends on Creative & Visual skills (not a primary focus for this role).
The formula is:


Match % = (Weight₁ × Score₁) + (Weight₂ × Score₂) + (Weight₃ × Score₃)


Where:


Weight₁ = Proportion of People & Communication (0.8 for Lead Generator)
Score₁ = Your People & Communication score (60%)
Weight₂ = Proportion of Technical & Analytical (0.2 for Lead Generator)
Score₂ = Your Technical & Analytical score (100%)
Weight₃ = Proportion of Creative & Visual (0.0 for Lead Generator)
Score₃ = Your Creative & Visual score (80%, but not used here)
Step-by-Step Calculation for Lead Generator
People & Communication Component:
Weight = 80% (or 0.8 as a decimal)
Your score = 60% (or 0.6 as a decimal)
Contribution = 0.8 × 60% = 0.8 × 0.6 = 0.48 (or 48%)
Technical & Analytical Component:
Weight = 20% (or 0.2)
Your score = 100% (or 1.0)
Contribution = 0.2 × 100% = 0.2 × 1.0 = 0.20 (or 20%)
Creative & Visual Component:
Weight = 0% (or 0.0)
Your score = 80% (not used since weight is 0)
Contribution = 0.0 × 80% = 0 (or 0%)
Total Match Percentage:
Sum the contributions: 48% + 20% + 0% = 68%
So:


0.8 × 60% + 0.2 × 100% = 48% + 20% = 68%


Why This Works
The weights (80% People & Communication, 20% Technical) reflect the relative importance of those skills for a Lead Generator. For example, generating leads relies heavily on communication (persuading clients) and a bit on technical ability (using CRM tools).
Your scores (60%, 100%) are scaled by these weights to show how your strengths align with the role’s needs.
The result, 68%, indicates a moderate-to-good fit—your technical strength boosts it, but your lower communication score tempers the overall match.
Verification
Weights sum to 100%: 80% + 20% + 0% = 100%
If you scored 100% in all categories (like the micro-test), it’d be: 0.8 × 100% + 0.2 × 100% = 80% + 20% = 100%, which makes sense for a perfect candidate.
Your actual scores (60% and 100%) produce a realistic spread, distinguishing Lead Generator from roles like Backend Developer (98%).
