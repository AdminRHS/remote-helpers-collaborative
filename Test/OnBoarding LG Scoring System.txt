🚀 Proposed CRM-Based Employee Performance Tracking & Motivation System
The 1-Week AI-Driven Onboarding Plan provides clear performance categories with KPIs. To enhance motivation and tracking, let's integrate:
✅ Automated Scoring System in CRM
✅ Real-Time KPI Dashboards
✅ Gamification & Performance Badges
✅ Automated Alerts & Notifications
✅ Bonus & Reward Tracking System
________________


1️⃣ Automated Performance Scoring System
Each onboarding category has a weight in the final score (100% total)—this should be automatically calculated based on employee actions within the CRM.
📊 Scoring Breakdown & CRM Automation
Category
	Weight (%)
	KPI to Track (CRM Integration)
	AI Fundamentals & Practical Use
	10%
	AI queries used, outreach optimization completed
	Google Sheets & Data Entry
	10%
	Data entry accuracy, formatting verified
	Search Quality & LinkedIn Usage
	15%
	# of effective search queries executed
	CRM Performance
	15%
	# of leads added, CRM data accuracy
	Lead Quality & Verification
	15%
	# of verified leads, correctness
	Communication & Outreach
	15%
	# of LinkedIn messages sent, engagement rate
	Business Knowledge
	10%
	Quiz results, knowledge checks
	Progress & KPIs
	10%
	# of leads contacted, conversion rates
	Client Call Scheduling & Follow-Up
	10%
	# of meetings scheduled, follow-up updates
	Final Test & Certification
	5%
	Exam pass rate, implementation success
	🔹 CRM Automation: Each employee action is tracked automatically in CRM fields (e.g., Leads Added, Messages Sent, Calls Scheduled).
🔹 Final Score Formula:
(Category Score × Weight) = Employee Performance Score (100%)
E.g., (90% in AI × 10%) + (85% in CRM × 15%) + ... = Final Score
🔹 Automation: CRM triggers alerts & reports when an employee’s score drops below 70%.
