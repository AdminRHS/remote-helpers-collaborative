Professional Suitability Assessment
Core Structure
I recommend a 3-tier assessment approach:
1. Micro-Test (5-10 questions): Brief screening to identify general strengths and potential professional categories
2. Category Mini-Tests (5 questions each): More specific questions in 3 key areas: People & Communication, Creative & Visual, and Technical & Analytical
3. Role-Specific Deep Dives (optional): Targeted questions for top-matching professions
Sample Micro-Test (10 Questions)
These questions indirectly assess aptitude across multiple professions:
1. Do you enjoy convincing people to try something new? (Yes/No)
2. Have you ever organized a list or schedule to keep things on track? (Yes/No)
3. Do you like creating something visual that others can admire? (Yes/No)
4. Have you ever figured out how something works just by tinkering with it? (Yes/No)
5. Do you find it fun to write messages or posts that grab attention? (Yes/No)
6. Have you ever tracked numbers or budgets to make a decision? (Yes/No)
7. Do you enjoy cutting, arranging, or editing things to make them better? (Yes/No)
8. Have you ever built something step-by-step using instructions or a plan? (Yes/No)
9. Do you like chatting with people to understand what they need? (Yes/No)
10. Have you ever experimented with tools or apps to see what you can create? (Yes/No)

Scoring Methodology
For mapping results to specific professions, I'll use a weighted scoring system:
1. Calculate category scores based on "Yes" answers (each Yes = 20% of category)
2. Apply weighted percentages to each profession based on how much it relies on each skill category
3. Calculate final profession match percentages
Example weights (based on requirements for each role):
* Lead Generator: 80% People & Communication, 20% Technical
* Backend Developer: 90% Technical, 10% Creative
* UI/UX Designer: 50% Creative, 50% Technical
Sample Task-Specific Questions
For targeted assessment of specific task templates like "set up ads campaigns":
1. "Have you ever convinced a friend to try something you liked?" (20%)
2. "Do you enjoy experimenting with different ways to present an idea?" (40%)
3. "Have you used a computer to promote something of yours?" (40%)
