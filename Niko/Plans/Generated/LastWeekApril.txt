Here's a thinking process to systematize the provided text:

Understand the Goal: The user wants to "systematize" a large block of seemingly raw notes, ideas, tasks, and thoughts. This means organizing it into a logical structure, identifying key themes, and making it more understandable and actionable.

Initial Scan & Identify Major Themes: Read through the entire text quickly to get a general sense of the topics. I see recurring themes like:

AI (Models, Learning, Integration, Tools like GPT-4o, Gemini, Vertex AI)
MCPs (Model Context Protocol) - integration, servers, library
Lead Generation (LeadGen tool, LinkedIn, B2B, automation)
CRM (Development, Laravel, HubSpot integration, structure)
Desktop App/Environment (Combining tools, communication hub)
Learning/Training (Employees, AI, exams, materials)
Project Management/Task Management (Notion, AirTable, templates, workflows)
Recruiting/HR (Interviews, CVs, onboarding, salaries, firing)
Specific Projects (Exam App, Inner Clients like oa-i.com, lg-n.com)
Personal Tasks (Apartment prep, errands, events, learning)
Company Structure/Strategy (Regeneration, workflows, roles, data flow)
SEO/Content (Keywords, strategy, website content)
Tools (Specific mentions like Cursor, SupaBase, Discord, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
People/Calls (Lilia, Recruiters, Dima, Polina, Artyom, Sales)
Choose a High-Level Structure: A good way to organize this might be by functional area or project type. Some potential top-level categories:

AI Development & Exploration
Lead Generation & Sales
CRM & Tooling Development
Project Management & Workflow
Employee Management & Training
Specific Projects
Personal Tasks
Company Strategy & Administration
Process Section by Section (or Group Related Items): Go through the original text again, assigning each point or related group of points to one of the chosen categories.

Format and Write: Organize the points under the refined categories using clear headings and bullet points. Rephrase slightly for clarity and consistency. Add introductory and concluding remarks. Ensure all original points are captured. Highlight key items like API keys/tokens but add a security warning.

Review and Edit: Read through the systematized output. Does it flow logically? Is it easy to understand? Is anything missing? Does it accurately reflect the input? Ensure formatting is correct. Add a disclaimer about sensitive info (API keys). Make sure the tone is neutral and organizational. Ensure all parts of the original prompt are addressed.
