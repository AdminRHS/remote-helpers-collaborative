I've tested thousands of AI tools and now I'm going to show you 100 best from
0:05
Simple Text editors to full-blown coding apps starting with General writing
Writing tools
0:12
tools for General allpurpose writing with super simple prompts I'd say go with Chad gbt they just updated it to
0:19
version 4.5 and we've got an awesome prompting guide for it it also works with images data analysis coding and
0:26
other fancy stuff but keep in mind you'll probably need a subscription yeah monthly fees right for slightly fewer
0:32
features but better search accuracy and sometimes even more creative writing I'd give Google Gemini 2 a try it can pretty
0:39
much do what Chad GPT does but it's free the trade-off is its reasoning skills aren't always quite as sharp every tool
0:45
out there charges you for advanced reasoning except deep seek you can run it locally on your own computer and it
0:51
reasons about as well as the 01 model just without Vision on the plus side you can upload data files into deep seek
0:58
which o1 won't let you do as a balanced option I'd check out Claude 3.7 it just
1:03
got an update and now it has great hybrid reasoning solid accuracy a low chance of making stuff up plus it
1:09
supports Vision prompting can be a bit tricky though so make sure you watch our full guide we also have a g Academy
1:15
course on claud's prompts download it and you can study at your own pace if you want to add some excitement to your
1:21
AI routine be a bit different try Gro 3 Elon musk's newest AI is on the same
1:27
level as Chad gbt's latest models it can reason generate images analyze data do
1:32
searches the whole nine yards all these tools can crank out as much text as you want but sometimes you need that extra
1:38
spark of creativity and control that's when I switched to Jasper it's fine-tuned for marketing content and CHS
1:45
out results that really sound human for product descriptions where you want a personal feel I like copy AI it's super
1:51
creative knows how to be persuasive and can dig up unique selling points for you without much input it's tough to call
1:58
Copy AI a real check GPT competitor but I think copy Smith beats it in one area
2:03
e-commerce writing copy Smith is practically a whole toolkit focused on online sales product descriptions
2:10
research optimizing articles all that good stuff if you'd rather dabble in creative writing with easy controls
2:16
there's text effects it's more of a fun experiment than a hardcore writing toll but it's awesome if you just want to
2:22
play around with words of course all these options require jumping into a separate website which is why I usually
2:29
run word tun in the background it works in Gmail Facebook and crucially in Google Docs it fixes my spelling and
2:35
scripts helps me rewrite bits and pieces and just makes life a little simpler text generation can be not only prom
2:42
based I have videos that would be great as blog posts so I can use video to blog to transform them they are sponsoring
2:48
this video and it's literally the number one video to text converter here's how it all works I just paste a YouTube link
2:54
to my video and with just one click the toll generates a clean ready to publish
3:00
blog article not only is it fast but the output quality is impressive the whole setup was incredibly simple no credit
3:07
card needed so I was able to jump right in and start testing what's cool is that it doesn't limit you to just YouTube
3:13
videos you can upload any video file with spoken audio and the toll works with it just as well plus your Target
3:20
and international audiences it's multilingual support and 30 plus languages is really useful also there is
3:27
built-in SEO optimization automatic visuals like screenshots or AI generate
3:32
images I can also turn on Automation and every new video I upload will be
3:37
instantly transformed into blog article if you post videos often this saves a
3:43
ton of time I really like this toll during my testing and people on G2 and Trust Pilots seem to agree with me try
3:50
video to blog AI now no credit card required click the link in the
3:55
description to start converting your videos into powerful blog articles the next type of AI tools is image
Image Generation
4:04
generation starting with the easiest AI to prompt and honestly the one with the most predictable results dially 3 it's
4:11
basically in dire need of an update but as a quick add-on for Chad gbt it does an okay job for fast simple image
4:18
creation just don't expect miracles with text generation here it's pretty middling most of the images you see on
4:23
GE Academy that have text in them actually come from mid Journey its text handling is far more accurate Plus gives
4:30
you real options for size orientation and all that good stuff and if you're into photo realism mid Journey Nails it
4:36
every time it even gets Anatomy right no more weird extra fingers the subscription might feel like a buzzkill
4:42
but if you want to avoid that you can always go the local route stability AI AKA stable diffusion has been ruling the
4:49
scene for a couple of years now for good reason it's accurate reliable and completely free new free competitors are
4:55
popping up left and right though take flux one for instance basically the same idea a but with text to video thrown in
5:01
it's a cool way to sharpen your AI skills if you ask me that said flux one struggles with text so for fancy
5:08
lettering or custom fonts Adobe Express is a more solid option it also lets you remove objects from photos gives you
5:14
plenty of style controls and just makes the whole generation process super user friendly for everyday image needs we
5:21
also have an image generator built right into G Academy is for our members and work similarly to Mid Journey just jump
5:27
into our AI art studio type Cas imagine followed by your prompt and voila being
5:33
a member also gets you access to tons of Education materials prompting guides toll collections audio commentary PDF
5:40
guides you name it we're creating a whole video series to teach AI basics in a simple no jargon way to we even have a
5:47
built-in toll finder to match you with the perfect AI toll and we drop exclusive deals and popular AI tolls
5:54
every week those deals to low and save you more than it costs to join G Academy so go ahead click the Link in the
6:00
description become a member and help us build the best AI Learning Hub ever some tools let you generate images from your
6:06
own sketches cray a AI for instance I'll scribble something on the left feed it a prompt and it will match the layout from
6:12
my sketch while filling in the details cray a AI won't turn your photos into videos though same goes for playground
6:19
AI there's simpler tools mainly designed for basic generation but they're dependable and easy to use perfect for
6:24
folks who just want quick results without fuss which might describe our moms dads or boss is right and if they
6:30
don't Vibe with that show them Leonardo AI it's nice and straightforward but it uses its own older model so sometimes
6:36
you get really unexpected but also kind of cool images sometimes weird is wonderful moving on editing your images
6:42
removing background upscaling Etc let's focus on the free stuff
Editing images
6:49
because honestly who wants another subscription for quick background removal I'd grab cutout throw it's
6:54
straightforward produces decent results and there's no subscription fee the catch you only get five credits to start
7:01
once you run out you can just make a new account no biggie if you don't mind paying a bit for better background
7:06
removal and integration with tools like canva or photoshop remove background is the way to go its algorithms are A step
7:13
above and the price is pretty reasonable for free upscaling big jpeg does the trick it can double or quadruple your
7:19
image resolution while boosting quality reliably the interface is simple and impossible to mess up hard to argue with
7:25
free right for affordable object removal try cleanup pictures does a solid job with end painting though the free
7:32
version kepts you at 720p resolution good enough for blogs or social posts
7:37
but if you're doing Pro level photography you might want a subscription that said the most impressive image editing tool I've tried
7:44
is magnific AI the upscaling is insane it adds detail refines textures and
7:49
basically fills in missing info so photos look like they were taken with a topof the line camera the downside the
7:55
subscription cost can be a bit steep for everyday folks now with f pH is covered it only seems appropriate to move on to
8:02
video tools both generation editing and repurposing these ones are the tools I
8:07
have used myself and some of them I still use pretty often Sora is still one of my go-to
Video tools
8:14
tools we actually put together a giant guide on it packed with tips prompts and other handy info the coolest thing about
8:20
Sora is the quality of his output it really sticks to whatever prompt you give it and delivers top-notch results
8:26
plus there's a neat storyline feature that's perfect for multi-step motion or more complex sequences Sora can be
8:33
pretty picky about prompts though sometimes you just need something super focused like videos about food or
8:38
emotion generated by a model trained specifically on those topics hot shot works with that perfectly it offers nine
8:45
different video types A userfriendly interface and a subscription that won't break the bank of course creativity
8:51
matters in video generation maybe you want everything from nit vids to celebrity Clips hyper can do that and
8:57
more it's similar to Sora but that sometimes struggles with fingers and moving objects so keep your expectations
9:04
in check if you're trying to generate High action scenes for simpler static scenes hyper is great but if you want to
9:09
push the envelope try pabs it has this C Pika frames feature that morphs one
9:14
image into another creating some wild transitions super Innovative and fun to play with generating videos isn't the
9:21
only game in town you can edit them too my top choice for that is Runway ml this tool is amazing at sinking lips to audio
9:28
removing backgrounds adding slow motion color grading you name it you can remove objects blur faces add depth of field
9:35
effects it's basically a giant playground for video editing Runway won't generate a full video for you from
9:41
scratch though and nid is your best bet in this case it'll take one prompt and
9:46
make an entire video complete with a storyline narration subtitles everything
9:51
except music and that's pretty standard in AI made videos music usually isn't included clip Fleet is no exception but
9:58
it can generate a full video with cuts and a voice over from your description and it also sprinkles in sound effects
10:04
to make things more engaging if you do want music in your AI video you can only get it by recycling footage that already
10:11
had music in it fortunately repurposing is a breeze with video just droing a link and it'll transcribe the video pick
10:17
out the good parts and spit out an edited version perfect for Tik Tok Instagram or shorts Opus Clips is
10:23
another popular repurposing toll offering basically the same features picking between these tolls often comes
10:29
down to how well they snip and trim your video the same goes for vizard iio
10:34
though this one might need some getting used to so that it works best should we make a guide on vizard go to GE Academy
10:41
and vote in the sometimes though you'll want to do a few edits on your own like adding subtitles to that AI generated
10:47
video that's where V IO comes in handy just use the auto subtitle feature or remove the background lock the eyes on
10:53
the camera repurpose the footage whatever you need it's a solid all-around video editor and for that
10:59
first pass of basic editing on your own videos cutting out long pauses trimming flubs and removing audio noise gling AI
11:06
is my top pick I actually did a full breakdown of it on this channel so go check out our faster video editing video
11:12
if you want all the details this brings us nicely to YouTube tools where saving time is everything but not at the cost
YouTube tools
11:19
of creativity instead of coming through endless videos why not get a quick
11:24
summary of their key points that's exactly what nopt does and you can even chat with the video to find topics worth
11:30
exploring further I use it myself and it's a huge time saer when I'm feeling too lazy to post videos manually I turn
11:37
to Taja AI it generates tags a description a neat list of chapters suggests a title optimizes for search
11:44
and even creates up some basic thumbnails they might not be breathtaking but hey at least the job's done sometimes though I like rolling up
11:51
my sleeves and digging into SEO on my own that's where vid IQ comes in it's so
11:56
good I can't keep quiet about it sure it does the usual key word research but it also has a fantastic idea suggestion
12:02
system it's basically the Perfect Blend of AI and real world data but wait it gets better sure you can use chat GPT
12:08
for your scripts but prompting can be a pain subscriber on the other hand holds your hand through every step from Deep
12:15
research to fine-tuning each piece of your script it does all the heavy lifting for titles descriptions hooks
12:22
you name it all you have to do is pick what you like super easy and friendly though not free sadly if you decide to
12:28
be a YouTuber or just make videos slightly faster you should really look into toes for generating
Generating Avatars
12:36
avatars when it comes to Avatar generation hey Jen is hands down the top dog I just upload a few minutes of video
12:42
footage with me talking plus a short consent video and after it processes everything I'm good to go the quality is
12:48
actually insane lip sync voice Clarity and even Zoom ins and zoom outs I can even upload my own voice over the
12:55
downside is it's pretty pricey if you want to go Allin with serious large scale Avatar creation honestly AI
13:01
avatars often feel a bit misleading most tools just animate a generic image and let you overlay it on presentations it's
13:08
that very formal corporate Vibe the only other Avatar tools that actually do something interesting are usually more
13:14
for fun take deep fakes LOL for example it lets you swap faces in videos which
13:19
is hilarious but doesn't necessarily make your workflow any easier it's just a fun gimmick if you're looking for
13:25
serious deep fake results I'd suggest deep face lab it's open source and super customizable so you can pull off some
13:32
pretty advanced stuff you won't quite get Hollywood level Irishman effects but it's still impressive for something you
13:38
can run at home face swapping is probably the most common trick these Avatar tools have up their sleeve check
13:43
out un boring for instance you just upload your files wait a minute and boom your face is swapped the results are
13:49
decently reliable and it throws in some extra bells and whistles to keep things interesting perfect for spicing up a
13:56
video here and there there aren't many use cases for AI avatars however for Speed generators there is far too many
14:03
just as there are far too many toasts that are worth your attention obviously the Top Dog in voice
Speech generators…
14:10
cloning is 11 Labs it doesn't just copy your voice it lets you find tune how
14:15
every single part of each sentence sounds from the intonation to the emphasis you could seriously spend hours
14:21
filling with it at that point you might as well just record the audio yourself but if you're a control freak about your
14:27
voice this is your dream come true if you want something simpler but still with great quality and ease of use check
14:34
out my vocal AI I've tested it myself and found it perfect for anyone who's new to voice cloning sometimes the
14:40
results need a bit of extra tweaking you can't do inside the tool but overall it's super handy listener AI is another
14:46
solid Choice I'm mostly just giving you options here they're all good in their own ways with tools like listener AI you
14:53
really have to try them for yourself and see which one sounds best to you feature-wise they're pretty similar
14:59
across the board need to boost your audio's overall quality or add some finer details maybe tweak it for
15:05
streaming videos or production then switch to fine voice it takes under a
15:10
minute to improve your audio's Clarity and it's totally worth it if you're a complete newbie with zero professional
15:16
needs a simpler and more stripped down toll might be what you're after murf AI
15:21
it's super easy to use delivers great Voice output and doesn't overload you with extra features you might never
15:27
touch anyway now murf doesn't have celebrity voices in its catalog which might be a deal breaker if you ever need
15:33
to mimic your favorite star in that case fake you.com has you covered the quality
15:38
is just okay and the selection of voices isn't massive but it gets the job done if you want something a little more fun
15:44
or novelty focused finally if you do record your own audio and it comes out well less than Stellar Adobe podcast is
15:50
here to save the day it's the simplest audio enhancer out there barely any settings to mess with and the free
15:56
version already does a great job the paid plan gives you more control but really it's all about what you need
16:02
sometimes free is just fine and music how can we forget about creating
Music tools
16:08
songs it's kind of wild but these days you can actually generate an entire song lyrics Melody instruments the whole
16:15
works from a single prompt with sunno you can specify the style BPM and so on it's super simple and the final tracks
16:22
sound surprisingly good if you want more control over your music like I do check out beat Hoven it's basically the the
16:29
same idea as sunno but you can choose your style from a list add different emotions tweak the exact length and more
16:35
it's definitely more customizable though maybe a little less reliable at times if you're more of a feeling person than a
16:41
technical one there's sound raw you just pick the mood of the track select the parameters you want and it does the rest
16:48
no prompt writing required no describing what you need just point click and you're good to go the F tracks from
16:54
these tools are great but sometimes you just want riffs that's where refusion steps in you can enter your lyrics or
17:00
describe the sound you're after and it'll generate short riffs with cool visualizations it can even crank Out
17:06
lyrics for you a handy sidekick if you're a musician looking for quick inspiration speaking of classical
17:11
imagine telling moart that AI can now pump out orchestral pieces on par with what he wrote well Iva might impress
17:19
even the Old Masters it's fantastic for classical music and 249 other styles no joke pick a key signature decide how
17:26
long you want the piece to be and how many tracks you need you also get three free downloads a month which is a sweet
17:31
deal usually once you generate a track that's all you get but Boomie does it differently you can add vocals rearrange
17:38
the track even swap out instruments or layer in random sounds like traffic noise if you want it's a really
17:44
refreshing approach to AI music and finally one more toe I love but can't really segue into smoothly vocal
17:51
remover. Org the name says it all just upload any track and it'll split the vocals from the instrumentals so you can
17:58
download them sep separately so far we've been keeping our AIS pretty creative but I really want to get
18:03
serious for a second let me put on my serious face and show you a couple of tools for business and
Business and Productivity
18:11
productivity I'm a total notion junkie so it's probably no surprise that I recommend notion AI to just about anyone
18:18
who listen it basically acts like Chad GPT inside your notion workspace summarizing notes generating text
18:25
creating lists bullet points even analyzing files and documents and writing code if you love notion already
18:30
this is the ultimate add-on if you're more of a Google person there's notebook llm you can drop in a video a website
18:37
link or any file and it'll analyze everything for you it even generates notes based on your uploaded files lets
18:43
you chat with them and can create quizzes you name it now if we suddenly lost Google Calendar or notion motion AI
18:50
would be my next go-to it's got built-in AI for managing tasks scheduling reminders and all that good stuff it's
18:57
more professional grade and might have a steeper learning curve but it can really streamline your workflow once you get
19:03
the hang of it of course there are a 100 AI tools out there literally and it's tough to pick the right one here's what
19:09
I usually do head to the AI tool finder in geek cademy describe my situation and let GE academ's AI dig up the best fits
19:17
for me saves a ton of time productivity can take many forms like building a website in record time with hokus you
19:24
just answer a few questions and boom it generates a fully functional nice looking site text images layout
19:30
optimization it does it all alternatively there's framer AI which does pretty much the same thing but has
19:36
its own spin on layouts honestly I choose based on which visuals you like best because the text and image
19:41
generation part is more or less the same across most of these Site Builders finally a confession I used to dread
19:47
taking meeting notes then I found otter it's just a browser extension you connect before your meeting and it
19:52
records and transcribes everything in real time it even captures images if you need it to now I can actually pay
19:59
attention during meetings without worrying about missing anything generating text is ai's bread and butter
20:04
so here are a few more tools for blogging creative writing and text
Blogging, creative writing, and text editing
20:10
editing because sometimes you just need a specialized option like uh pseudo write which has been trained
20:16
specifically on creative writing think novels and short stories it can suggest plot tweaks for bigger impact generate
20:23
fresh dialogue where it's needed and help polish your style so everything reads smoothly quill goes above and
20:29
beyond platforms like chat GPT by offering a built-in paraphraser grammar checker plagiarism Checker and
20:36
summarization tool you just paste in your text and edit away keeping full control of the final output if you're
20:42
really serious about writing and don't want AI to steal your personal flare you need a toll that suggests changes rather
20:48
than autof fixing everything that's where Lex AI comes in you upload your draft it gives feedback and comments and
20:55
you decide which suggestions to accept it's optimized for folks who plan on publishing their work so it's ready for
21:00
Prime Time a more all-in one toe should not only write but also rewrite reply to
21:05
emails edit and do research basically a Chad GPT with all the knobs turned up
21:11
I'd go with hyperr right for that reliable straightforward and versatile or you could try writer for more
21:16
demanding projects it focuses on sounding human matching a realistic writing style instead of spitting out
21:22
words for the sake of it despite having a bunch of features it's still easy to navigate you'll always know where to
21:28
click and what to fill in you can even use it without filling with complicated prompts so send it to your mom if you
21:33
like if she or you work in the office or at the uni you might need a presentation
Presentation builders
21:41
Builder and you probably want something fast and reliable slides wizard is a great place to start you just type in a
21:48
topic and it creates up a structured outline all the text and even images for your slides it's a simple and quick fix
21:54
for anyone who's new to making slides I love TOS that play nicely with other and having a chat GPT plugin is usually a
22:01
good sign smart slides is the only one on this list that has that it's also got improved built-in charting compared to
22:07
other TOS many of them don't do chars at all plus it's pretty flexible when it comes to layouts sometimes even that's
22:12
not enough and you need to get really creative with your slides slide flow offers loads of editing options so your
22:19
presentation looks and feels One of a Kind the truth is good presentations need good visuals so it's worth picking
22:26
a toll based on how the final slides look that's why we have presentation templates slides go for example has a
22:32
bunch of AI generated templates you can customize you can tweak Styles set the tone and even use built-in AI to add
22:39
images or translate slides I prefer my presentations to be a bit more fun more interactive you know like polls quizzes
22:46
and audience q&as that's where send steps comes in it gives your viewers a chance to participate which makes the
22:53
info easier to take in I really wish I'd had these TOS when I was a student all I ever did was toss in some animations and
23:00
hope for the best but now ai can even do that for you presentations AI doesn't just add animations to whole slides or
23:06
specific elements it'll also automatically adjust layouts and movement to fit your content while you
23:12
just sit back and chill I want to say every presentation generator is unique but let's be honest they're pretty
23:17
similar beautiful AI is another tool that covers most of the same bases AI templates easy editing and automatic
23:23
content generation but somehow the slides it generates just look more polished to me I can't explain it they
23:29
just do on the flip side sometimes the simplest solution is the best pitch is great if you want to create up something
23:35
super fast without paying a ton of money you just describe the presentation and that's it no fancy customization or
23:42
extra settings you get what you get and there's a certain charm to that Simplicity if you want to create your own infographics to drop into your
23:48
slides try my lens AI it doesn't generate presentations but it does produce a variety of charts graphs and
23:54
other visuals you can even have a dig for data on the web and do a bunch of different inputs oh and it's totally
Dev Tools
24:00
free so you've got nothing to lose I feel like I'm forgetting something that's right developers sorry guys my
24:07
bad here's some cold toes for you and if that's not enough we've just posted a list of AI toes for developers in GE
24:13
Academy all with explanations and tips on building an efficient development
24:19
workflow for everyday code and help you can always just stick with Chad GPT or Gro but they don't really integrate with
24:26
your development environment if you're using vs code for instance tabn is worth a look it's got predictive autocomplete
24:32
filling in entire functions and shaving off keystrokes as you type it also comes with an AI chat feature so you can ask
24:39
for explanations debug tips and ideas without leaving your editor GitHub co-pilot X offers a slightly different
24:46
experience one feature I love is generate from comments you write a plain English comment and co-pilot turns it
24:53
into fully functional code it can also generate entire functions suggest Snippets and finisher code for you
25:00
co-pilot is powered by open AI codex but there are other specialized options code T5 for example has a different
25:07
architecture and produces slightly different results though still very Solid Source AI also uses codex and
25:13
covers the same Basics as co-pilot rewriting bug fixes suggestions just without that Nifty generate from
25:19
comments feature most Dev focused AI tools tend to do the same sorts of things so it comes down to what you're
25:25
personally comfortable with having more options is always a good thing another Contender is mutable which can refactor
25:32
your code generate documentation and even review your code but it's basically like all the other TOS here but Amazon
25:39
code whisper might beat them all it supports multiple programming languages integrates with popular idees and offers
25:45
realtime code suggestions you can also generate unit tests run security scans and crucially it's a license aware so
25:52
you're not accidentally ripping off someone else's code I'm not much of a developer myself but I can appreciate a
25:58
good toll though research might be more of my thing my all-time favorite for research
Research
26:05
is perplexity we even did a whole video about it recently it's just amazing super detailed in-depth userfriendly and
26:13
best of all free for the majority of your research needs you won't even need a subscription it's hard to top
26:19
perplexity though Chad gbt's deep research is catching up it takes about 5 to 10 minutes to generate an answer but
26:26
rather than just throwing quotes at it synthesizes everything it finds pair that with its reasoning abilities and
26:32
you've got a pretty solid tool these two options are high level but sometimes you just want simple summarizing especially
26:39
for academic research scholar C was specially trained on research papers students and teachers will notice how it
26:45
digs deeper pulls out key findings and highlights citations in a super useful way elicit does basically the same thing
26:52
