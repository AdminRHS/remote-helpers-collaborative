Instruction Guide for Task Templates
1. What are Task Templates?
Task templates are repetitive activities that need to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a deadline to work towards work-related goals. Task templates are created using Google Forms, that help employees follow standardized processes for tasks such as register job accounts, create job posts, or make job requests. These templates ensure that tasks are completed correctly, using the right tools and following company guidelines.
Each template follows a strict structure to ensure uniformity across departments.
2. Structure of Task Templates
Each task template follows a consistent structure, which includes several key components:
Task Template Components:
1. Name: The name of the task, following the format Action + Object. This is essential for consistency.
Actions - specific task that needs to be performed to achieve a goal. Use verbs in the present tense (e.g., Create, Develop, Generate). Choose verbs that indicate the start of a process or lead to a result, making them clear and directly related to your Objects.
Objects -  plural noun, 1-2 words, representing the entities a profession works with or manages in its activities. These can be tangible items (e.g., "Clients" for a Sales Manager) or abstract concepts (e.g., "Tasks" for a Project Manager).
2. Description: A concise summary (up to 500 symbols) of the task that needs to be completed.
Example: "Register a company account on a job site, confirm the registration via email, complete the company profile, ensure login security, and upload the required documents."
3. Profession: The specific profession or department responsible for the task.
Example: Recruiter, HR, Sales manager.
Example: Create job template (prof: recruiter, act: create, obj: job templates).
Step Templates:
Each task is broken down into individual steps, making it easier to tackle complex tasks. These steps consist of specific, simple, and clear actions, grouped together and requiring only one tool to complete.
   1. Name: The title of the specific step (e.g., "Website Registration," "Registration Confirmation").
   2. Tool: The tool required for the step (e.g., CRM, Gmail, ChatGPT).
   3. Responsibility: Actions that can be performed with the object
Checklist Items:
These are the actionable items within each step, providing detailed instructions for employees.
   1. Name: The name of the specific checklist item (e.g., "Open CRM," "Go to Job Sites").
   2. Guide: A brief, step-by-step guide for completing the checklist item. It may include visual aids like screenshots.
