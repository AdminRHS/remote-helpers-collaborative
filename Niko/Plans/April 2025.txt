Posting can Advertising
 Since we don't have enough human power to separately work on the content the content should come from our employees.  It means actually each one of them would need to generate content.  The main question would be which content is most relevant and can get engagement from people. So we do come to the target audience that we have to be significant  Directions as for example we have candidates that are looking for job and they visit our websites and our social media that are dedicated to specific profession or to job openings that we have in our company.   The other target audience is a business owners that are interested in totally different approach  But on the same materials.  The common point between both of them is they're all interested in specific task executions the candidates have the responsibilities and the clients are interested at how those tasks could benefit their business.
 This solution is to post on both directions the tasks workflows,  The information on how to execute those tasks would serve as a good learning materials for attracting traffic from candidates while the clients will see those materials as a proof of concept that we actually can provide the product that we are pitching about.  The other core advantage is that the keywords are almost the same and each one of the fields would enhance the backlinking strategy.




 The question is only about whether we take those tasks because creating them manually significantly decrease the speed and ability to analyse and improve the process with ai.  Though the proposal is to build a life generated educational system that would not only teach newcomers how to do things and maybe not only newcomers but also existing employees integrating new approaches and new tools into their work increasing output speed.  It means that AI would generate tasks flow based on the market research of new tools. They would verify that those tasks flows are actually correct and bringing to that result confirming it with the screen record where they execute those tasks.


 Once it's verified it can be published in a different format or maybe at first forwarded to the design and video generation as a prompt for further automation.  The images and video and different formats of text should be published the same day or at least two days for the whole process since their employee got the task


 Now we need the starting point where do we start from  The difficulty is that we need a system that would constantly generate those tasks not only be based on manual or human input.  We definitely need a system that would store those results like learning materials executed tasks and  employees experience  Match the price and post on our website as a service and promote it on social networks emails forums communities etc.


Lead Generation Improvement
 The thing is that we don't know what are the tasks. So the actual tasks will be generated from the project flow itself.
 The goal is to adapt fast to the new solutions for doing the same old things much faster with help of ai.  There are a bunch of things that we can improve with AI starting from pitching our clients with the actual proposal of their needs after investigating their company with AI.  The deep research on the company would allow us to collect their social networks websites and all of their publications in the web to see what can be improved or where our services can be needed to the client and then just propose him a solution with some examples that can be given to him as a freebie to interest him in a call with us.
 The outreach is done manually for now and during the last years we have collected about 1 million records that are not fully documented and some of them are missing information.  So the first step would be to transfer out all database and run it through enrichment process but since those are big quantities of data and the amount of research that need to be done that would require a lot of comput e power and we would need to set up appropriate web server power to actually export the data and reach it and put it in a new databas.  Then the logistic approach explaining all the data flow and the outcome.  Their outcome would be client oriented pitch about his needs more more than about our services that was potentially bringing us more calls.  The manual outreach should be converted to a lot of automations approaching client not only in Linkedin but also in email whatsapp SMS social networks comments contact fields etc.
 We need to split it into the tasks with smaller steps attach people to it and follow up calendar flow with the timings to get it up and running in shortest amount of time possible.  We would need developer to work with share and pulling data out we would need someone to help set up the server and train it with AI to enhance the data,  calculating how much money will it cost us to how much power can it require if the amount is less than one thousand dollars we can go for it.


 Once we identify what is our tasks and learning materials generation processes then we would be able to filter database of our clients to match those one who potentially would be interested in those tasks. For example  We would sort all the companies that have youtube channel and then generate lessons that is actually optimizing youtube channel titles setting lists of video and actually promoting it on initial stage with Google ads getting first actions and results recorded on video can be shown to our clients as case studies.  Following the common recommendation of selling those things that you have done yourself.


Comments
 Let's say that we do succeed with the tasks flow and lead generation and we do get new client that are requiring different things sometimes those that we didn't learn yet or Did not implement yet,  So the comments from the call with the clients can be a source for the task generation preparing people for the upcoming interview with teaching them those materials that clients are demanding.  Here we have first task we need to pull the last comments from the three months into notebook lm  And extract the list of tasks that we can consider as a first educational topics after running them through a deep research verifying how they can be done better with AI.
 




While you answer to me I have an idea that we actually can provide deep research on clients as a manual test task for now to the regeneration managers that would learn how to collect much more information that they are doing now and fit the proposal to the client. Since we need a list of test tasks to start from that would be a good and needed example.

Since we need a list of test tasks to start from that would be a good and needed example.
Lets try to execute this plan for now to have kind of mock up on the business formula to see if it's actually working and if it's correct and make fixes now on the paper before we are going to give it to the people act as my business partner to actually improve the formula and see where we have pitfalls and what can go wrong. significantly speed up the process Splitting it to maximum one day tasks or even more than that go to the half a day or two 3 hour task steps. For example conducting deep research on the client shouldn't take more than half an hour especially if you have listed tasks flow like where to push and which button to hit.
Select configure ai task generation we already can have a prompt for example for GPT Gemini or Grog to run the research taking one company from linkedin for example our own remote helpers and see already what can be a prompt result. If we put a plan of multiple steps that we would execute now in the chat we would say that let's run a market research of AI for the last week and see what are the latest tools in the fields of design video generation content generation lead generation recruiting content management etc. We would also build a test task that would be split in two steps and each step would have a checklist to verify that we actually hit the target. For the initial development stage it would be enough to have some Json format files that already can be or serve as a database for initial applications.
For the lead generation we can separate it to separate parallel project that can run and we already can research and discover the steps to set it up getting some answer already instead of just putting it into the list of things to be done. Our database is in Mysql but its weight is too big taking some gigabytes of memory that becomes very complicated to extract specific lists of data and we need solution for that. Regarding the data enrichment we already can prepare a prompt or test task getting deep research on our own company. All that feels like a lot for me to hold in my head so maybe we can start from the short review or maybe kind of mind map to understand the flow and getting it to much much smaller steps
We will do need to write prompt for the deep research of the clients I have mentioned before the list of information that can be gathered for considering what are the company needs in a remote workforce. Though the initial steps that we would run would be not creating task for the regeneration to explore the company we would run the market research on the companies get that get funding maybe through different investment platforms we also want to find the news AI companies or other companies that succeed as well as we can go through the job websites of the countries and social networks to identify those who are hiring or publishing job openings. Then the next stage would be actually running the prompt on the research so both of those tasks we can execute now the question is how much memory do you have to actually follow the conversation with me keeping the first message in your memory so that we would stick to the overall plan or your memory is limited to message from message. We don't need for now to put in time but we definitely would need to prepare proposal for the company that we have done research on and pitch or approach the company with their exact needs and not with our product description. I like actually the Micro Task Two and two let's plan Automation so that the actual company can be provided in advance so we can actually execute the whole flow here and now. I love the pitfall check the main task for the legendary to actually verify that all links are working and updated and that the information that we got on the research is correct. We can even put a mark on the lead that is verified. I like micro task three and one for the company's least research we would like to examine the companies from the perspective of hiring people from us since we have our staffing company. Also I would like you to help me adapt all your structure to our task manager structure where we have project milestones tasks steps and checklist so instead of micro tasks 6.2 you can use those name conventions and for the software platforms we use name tools. We definitely want it to be augmented and integrating employees into the workflow considering that we have lead generation managers we have technical department and we have design and we do department as well as recording and hour so we do need to plan those tasks in a single business flow with parallel actions for different departments ensuring their full time employment.


Analytics:
 Since we have an issue of viewing reports and analyzing them with human mind, and especially making conclusions from them, instead of that, we want to integrate gamification with scoring system leader boards, etc. So that actually each one of us would see the daily results and contribution to the company success through the achievements. inside the game that would include monitoring education. flow like learning new materials as well as executing test tasks. since those test tasks will be published on the website with the name of employees. So definitely pretty fast. We will identify those who are more successful.


 Once we have the list of. the list of new acquired skills by employee, it will be much easier to match the people to the. upcoming tasks to giving them to those who are who have more chance to execute them faster or execute them at all.  As well as fast matching to the client requirements


Learning Game:


 We want people to learn as fast as possible their latest things though the theory that we have is that if we prove the learning into the games and we add some competition inside the team that will give us big advantage in the practical learning and workload of the people as well as showing their statistics.  Moreover we would like to post those learning materials with the games on our platform so that not only our employees would benefit from it but also candidate the pipeline for potential candidates that could apply to work in our company.  From the other side the clients who would like to hire people would look nothing to the people but primary inclusive tasks that they are interested for us to do and the page will be confirmation of our experience


Imagine this:
We run a company that helps other companies by lending them our awesome workers (like superheroes!) when they have too much work or need special skills.
But, we can't just knock on every company's door and say, "Want some superheroes?" That would be silly!
So, here's our simple plan:
1. Find the Right Doors to Knock On: First, we need to figure out which companies might actually need our superheroes right now. It's like finding friends who look like they might need help carrying their school books.

   * How do we do this? We look for clues! Maybe we see companies that just got a lot of money (like getting a big allowance – they might want to buy more help!). Or maybe we see companies posting lots of "Help Wanted" signs online. We need someone (like a Team Lead) to make a list of these companies that might need help.
   2. Peek Through the Window (Politely!): Once we have a list of companies, we don't just barge in! We need to understand what kind of help they might need. So, for one company on the list, we try to learn all about them.

      * How? We can use our super-smart computer helper (that's the AI!) to quickly read everything it can find online about that company – like what they make, if they're hiring, or if they just announced something big. It's like the computer does super-fast homework about the company for us.
      3. Check Our Homework: The computer helper is fast, but sometimes it makes mistakes or misunderstands things. So, someone from our team needs to double-check the computer's homework.

         * How? They look at the computer's report and check if the links work and if the information makes sense by looking at the company's real website or news pages. It's like making sure your homework answers are right before you show the teacher.
         4. Figure Out the Best Way to Offer Help: Now that we've checked our homework and know more about the company, we can think of the perfect way to ask if they need our superheroes. Instead of just saying "Want help?", we can say something specific, like, "I saw you're building a giant new robot! Sometimes finding enough robot builders is tricky. Do you need help with that?" It shows we understand them.

That's the main idea! Find the right companies, understand them well, check our facts, and then offer help in a smart way.
Side Quests (Things we do at the same time):
            * Tidy Up Our Old Address Book: We have a HUGE, messy address book (our database) with contacts from years ago. We need someone from our tech team to figure out the best way to clean it up and make it useful again.
            * Look for New Gadgets: We also want someone to keep an eye out for new computer tools (other AIs!) that could help us do all this even faster or better in the future.
