# Service Layer Architecture Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the service layer architecture to support the proposed database split. Each service will be responsible for a specific domain and will expose APIs for other services to consume.

## Core Services

### 1. Identity Service
- **Primary Database**: Auth & Identity Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Role and permission management
  - User profile management
  - Session management
  - Password reset and account recovery
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - User authentication endpoints
  - User and role management endpoints
  - Permission verification endpoints
- **Consumers**: All other services

### 2. Talent Service
- **Primary Database**: Talent Management Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Talent profile management
  - Skills and certifications tracking
  - Talent search and matching
  - Rate and pricing management
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Talent CRUD operations
  - Profile search endpoints
  - Skills and rates management
- **Consumers**: Project Service, Task Service, Job Service

### 3. Task Service
- **Primary Database**: Task Management Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Task creation and tracking
  - Task template management
  - Step management and progression
  - Task assignment and scheduling
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Task CRUD operations
  - Template management
  - Task assignment endpoints
  - Task status and progress tracking
- **Consumers**: Project Service, Talent Service, Reporting Service

### 4. Project Service
- **Primary Database**: Project Management Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Project creation and tracking
  - Milestone management
  - Project templates management
  - Resource allocation
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Project CRUD operations
  - Milestone management
  - Project analytics
- **Consumers**: Task Service, Reporting Service, Communication Service

### 5. Job Service
- **Primary Database**: Job Marketplace Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Job posting and management
  - Application processing
  - Candidate matching
  - Job site integration
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Job CRUD operations
  - Application management
  - Job search and filtering
- **Consumers**: Talent Service, Communication Service, Reporting Service

### 6. Tools Service
- **Primary Database**: Account & Tool Management Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Tool and account management
  - Access control for external tools
  - Integration with third-party services
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Tool CRUD operations
  - Account management
  - Access verification
- **Consumers**: All other services

### 7. Communication Service
- **Primary Database**: Communication Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Internal messaging
  - Notification management
  - Comment handling
  - Communication history
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Message delivery
  - Notification management
  - Comment CRUD operations
- **Consumers**: All other services

### 8. Reporting Service
- **Primary Database**: Reporting Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data aggregation from other services
  - Report generation
  - Analytics processing
  - Dashboard data preparation
- **Exposed APIs**:
  - Report generation endpoints
  - Analytics queries
  - Dashboard data endpoints
- **Consumers**: All other services (for analytics)

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- GraphQL for aggregated data requests from frontend applications
- Request/response pattern for immediate needs

### 2. Asynchronous Communication
- Event-driven architecture for cross-service data consistency
- Message queues for handling background tasks
- Publish/subscribe pattern for notifications and updates

### 3. Data Consistency
- Eventual consistency model for cross-database references
- Dual-write pattern with compensating transactions for critical operations
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for complex read/write scenarios

## Service Discovery & API Gateway

### API Gateway
- Single entry point for external clients
- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Request routing to appropriate services
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API versioning management

### Service Discovery
- Service registry for dynamic service discovery
- Health checks for service availability
- Load balancing for distributed service instances

## Security Considerations

### Cross-Service Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT for service-to-service authentication
- Fine-grained permission checks at service boundaries
- Rate limiting for inter-service communication

### Data Security
- Encryption in transit for all service communication
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Auditing and logging for cross-service operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
- Docker containers for each service
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment management

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing for each service
- Independent deployment of services
- Blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry for tracing requests across services
- Correlation IDs for request tracking

### Centralized Logging
- Structured logging format across all services
- Log aggregation and search capabilities

### Metrics and Alerts
- Service health metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Proactive alerting

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Services
1. Identity Service
2. Talent Service
3. Task Service

### Phase 2: Supporting Services
1. Project Service
2. Tools Service
3. Communication Service

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Job Service
2. Reporting Service
3. Advanced analytics and integration

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
- Incremental migration of data to new database structure
- Dual-write during transition period
- Validation and reconciliation tools

### Service Transition
- Strangler pattern for gradually replacing monolithic functionality
- Feature toggles for controlling service adoption
- Parallel running of old and new systems during transition
