## Implementation Notes for AI

When implementing this structure in Airtable:

1. **Create tables in sequence**:
   - Start with standalone entities (Tool Types, Departments)
   - Then create entities with dependencies (Tools, Professions)
   - Finally create junction tables

2. **Link records efficiently**:
   - Use Airtable's "Linked Record" field type for all relationships
   - For many-to-many relationships, first create both primary tables, then establish links

3. **Formula field considerations**:
   - Airtable uses a different formula syntax than SQL
   - Use IF() instead of CASE statements
   - Use proper field references in {}

4. **Rollup calculations**:
   - For complex calculations, you may need intermediate lookup fields
   - Some calculations may require multiple rollup steps

5. **Performance optimization**:
   - Large linked record sets can slow down Airtable
   - Consider using filtered linked records where appropriate
   - Use count fields instead of rollups for simple counting

This extension provides a comprehensive framework for managing tools, departments, and professions within your existing project management system in Airtable.
