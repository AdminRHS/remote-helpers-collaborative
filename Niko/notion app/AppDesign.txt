Technical Implementation Description: Company Development Plan Dashboard
Here's a technical description of how the Streamlit dashboard was implemented, which you can use as a reference for implementing similar functionality in other projects:

Architecture Overview
The dashboard uses a simple, modular architecture:

Data Processor Module

Standalone Python module for parsing text data
Creates structured data representations (DataFrames)
Handles dependency graph generation
Calculates progress statistics
Multi-Page Streamlit Application

Main app.py serving as the dashboard entry point
Dedicated pages in separate modules for each major section
Shared styling and navigation components
Key Technical Components
1. Data Parsing and Processing
The data_processor.py implements text parsing with these key functions:

def parse_plan_data():
    # Reads the raw text file
    # Uses regex patterns to extract structured data
    # Organizes data into pandas DataFrames by section
    # Returns dictionary of DataFrames
def get_dependency_graph():
    # Creates NetworkX graph representation of dependencies
    # Enables network analysis and visualization
    
def calculate_progress_stats(dataframes):
    # Computes statistics for completion tracking
    # Aggregates metrics across categories
2. Visualization Components
The dashboard uses multiple visualization libraries:

Plotly Express - For interactive charts (pie, bar, timeline)
Plotly Graph Objects - For custom visualizations (network graphs, gauges)
Altair - For specialized data visualizations
NetworkX - For dependency graph structure and analysis
Streamlit Native Components - For progress bars, metrics, expandable sections
3. Page Structure
Each page follows a consistent structure:

# Configuration
st.set_page_config(...)
# Data loading
dataframes = parse_plan_data()
# Filters in sidebar
st.sidebar.title("Filters")
# Filter definitions...
# Top-level metrics
st.metric(...) # Key performance indicators
# Visualizations
fig = px.bar(...) # or other chart types
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
# Detailed data views
for section in sections:
    with st.expander(...):
        # Section details
4. Data Structure
The application organizes data into these primary structures:

Task tracking with status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started)
Hierarchical organization (sections, subsections, tasks, subtasks)
Timeline representation (periods, milestones)
Dependency relationships (source â†’ target mappings)
Implementation Techniques
Text Parsing Strategy

Regular expressions for structured text extraction
Pattern matching for hierarchical data
Status tracking from checkbox syntax - [ ] or - [x]
Interactive Filters

Sidebar filters that cascade through visualizations
State management using Streamlit's session state
Responsive Layout

Column-based layout with responsive containers
Dynamic height adjustments for visualizations
Container-width charts that adapt to screen size
Progress Tracking

Completion rate calculations across categories
Status-based filtering and visualization
Color-coded indicators for status representation
Dependency Analysis

Network centrality measures for critical path identification
Visual node sizing based on connection count
Interactive graph layout for exploring relationships
Deployment Considerations
Server Configuration

[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000
Performance Optimization

Data parsing performed once per session
Caching of computation-heavy functions
Optimized visualization rendering
Extensibility

Modular code structure for adding new visualizations
Separate pages for independent section development
Clear data interfaces between components
This architecture can be adapted for any project requiring structured data visualization, progress tracking, and dependency analysis.
