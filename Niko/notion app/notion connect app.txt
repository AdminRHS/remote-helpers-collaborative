Phase 1: Core Database and Basic Discord Notifications (Focus: Foundation & Immediate Value)


Create a dedicated Discord server for the project management system.
Establish channels corresponding to key project areas 
(e.g., #general, #project-updates, #task-notifications, #milestone-updates).
Set up roles for different user types 
(e.g., Project Manager, Team Member, Client).
Basic Discord Notifications (via Webhooks):
Implement basic Discord notifications for critical events using Notion webhooks and Discord webhooks.
Task Assignments: 
When a task is assigned, send a notification to the #task-notifications channel with task details and assignee.
Milestone Updates: When a milestone's status changes (e.g., completed, delayed), send a notification to the #milestone-updates channel.
Project Updates: When a project's status changes, send a notification to the #project-updates channel.
Use a middleware service like Make or Zapier to handle the webhook interactions, to format the data, and to send the information to the correct discord channels.
Calendar Invite Structure:
Define the structure of the Job Review calendar invites.
Determine required fields (e.g., date, time, participants, agenda, soft for conference).
Decide on the calendar service to be used (e.g., Google Calendar).
Begin to create a notion database to store the information needed to create the calendar invites.
Phase 2: Analytics Dashboards and Enhanced Discord Integration (Focus: 
Enhanced Functionality & User Experience)

Analytics Dashboards:
Develop custom dashboards within Notion using linked database views and formulas.
Prioritize key metrics relevant to project managers and team members.
Consider using Notion's chart views for visual representation of data.
Enhanced Discord Integration:
Implement more sophisticated Discord notifications.
Daily/Weekly Task Summaries: 
Send daily or weekly summaries of assigned tasks to individual team members via direct messages or a dedicated channel.
Project Progress Reports: Generate and send project progress reports to the #project-updates channel at regular intervals.
Implement Discord bot commands to pull information from the Notion databases.
Continue to refine the Job review calendar invite process.
Refine User Roles and Permissions:
Adjust Discord roles and permissions based on user feedback and usage patterns.
Ensure appropriate access to channels and information for different user groups.
Phase 3: Advanced Integrations and Automation (Focus: Automation & Scalability)

Advanced Webhook Integrations:
Explore integrations with other tools used in the project management workflow 
(e.g., version control systems, design tools).
Automate data synchronization between Notion and these tools using webhooks.
Discord Bot Development:
Consider developing a custom Discord bot to enhance interaction with the Notion databases.
Implement bot commands to retrieve project information, create tasks, and update statuses.
Automated Job Review Calendar Invites:
Automate the creation and distribution of Job Review calendar invites using a service like Zapier or Make.
Trigger the automation based on events in the Notion database.
