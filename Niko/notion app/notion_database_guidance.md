# AI Guidance: Creating Notion Database Structures from Relational Schema

## 1. Database Structure Analysis

### Analysis of Current Schema

The provided database schema represents a project management system with the following key entities:

1. **Project Templates**
   - Core entity for project planning
   - Contains basic project information (name, description, hours)

2. **Task Templates**
   - Fundamental work units
   - Rich relational structure (actions, objects, professions, steps)
   - Contains detailed metadata (cost, hours, frequency)
   - Organized by types and can have parent-child relationships

3. **Milestone Templates**
   - Represents project checkpoints
   - Can contain multiple task templates
   - Has ordering capability via queue

4. **Connector Tables**
   - Multiple many-to-many relationship tables
   - Connect projects to tasks, milestones to tasks, etc.
   - Some include additional metadata (queue positions)

### Schema Strengths
- Well-normalized structure with proper relationship tables
- Good use of foreign keys for entity relationships
- Comprehensive metadata for tasks

### Schema Improvement Opportunities
- Some entity tables are missing complete field definitions
- Consider adding status fields for workflow management
- Potential for additional metadata on relationship tables

## 2. Notion Database Conversion Principles

### Key Considerations

1. **Database Type Selection**
   - Choose between page-based and inline databases based on complexity
   - Use page-based databases for primary entities with many properties
   - Use inline databases for simpler related collections

2. **Property Type Mapping**
   - SQL data types map to Notion property types:
     - VARCHAR → Text/Title properties
     - SMALLINT/INT → Number properties
     - BOOLEAN → Checkbox properties
     - TIMESTAMP → Date properties
     - Foreign keys → Relation properties

3. **Relationship Handling**
   - Direct 1:1 or 1:N relationships: Use Relation + Rollup properties
   - Many-to-Many relationships: Create separate database or use multi-select
   - Join tables with metadata: Must be separate databases

4. **Database Organization**
   - Group related databases in workspace sections
   - Consider visibility and access patterns
   - Create views for common filtering/sorting needs

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Core Entity Databases

Create the primary entity databases:

1. **Project Templates Database**
   - Properties:
     - Name (Title)
     - Description (Text)

     - Is Draft (Checkbox)
     - Created At (Date)
     - Created By (Relation → Users database)
     - Task Template Type (Relation → Task Template Types database)

3. **Milestone Templates Database**
   - Properties:
     - Name (Title)
     - Description (Text)

4. **Step Templates Database**

### Step 2: Establish Relationships

Add relation properties to connect databases:

     - Milestone Templates (Relation → Milestone Templates)

2. **Task Templates Database**
   - Add Relations:
     - Action (Relation → Actions)

     - Child Tasks (Relation → Task Templates, self-relation)
     - Step Templates (Relation → Step Templates)
     - Professions (Relation → Professions)

3. **Milestone Templates Database**
   - Add Relations:
     - Task Templates (Relation → Task Templates)
     - Projects (Relation → Project Templates)

### Step 3: Add Advanced Properties

Enhance databases with rollups and formulas:

1. **Project Templates Database**
   - Add Rollups:
     - Total Tasks (Rollup → Milestone Templates → Task Templates, Count)
     - Estimated Total Hours (Rollup → Milestone Templates → Task Templates → Expected Hours, Sum)

2. **Task Templates Database**
   - Add Rollups:
     - Step Count (Rollup → Step Templates, Count)
     - Total Child Tasks (Rollup → Child Tasks, Count)

3. **Milestone Templates Database**
   - Add Rollups:
     - Task Count (Rollup → Task Templates, Count)
     - Total Hours (Rollup → Task Templates → Expected Hours, Sum)

### Step 4: Create Join Tables as Databases (When Needed)

For relationship tables with metadata:

1. **Milestone Template Task Template Database**
   - Properties:
     - Name (Title, formula combining related entities)
     - Milestone Template (Relation → Milestone Templates)
     - Task Template (Relation → Task Templates)
     - Queue Position (Number)

### Step 5: Create Useful Views

For each database, create specialized views:

1. **Project Templates Database**
   - Views:
     - All Projects (Default)
     - By Estimated Hours (Sorted)
     - By Milestone Count (Sorted)

2. **Task Templates Database**
   - Views:
     - All Tasks (Default)
     - By Type (Grouped)
     - Draft Tasks (Filtered)
     - Parent Tasks Only (Filtered)
     - By Profession (Grouped)

3. **Milestone Templates Database**
   - Views:
     - All Milestones (Default)
     - By Project (Grouped)
     - By Task Count (Sorted)

## 4. Implementation Process for AI

When implementing this database structure in Notion, follow these steps:

   - Identify all entities and their relationships
   - Determine cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
   - Identify which entities need dedicated databases

2. **Map Data Types**
   - Convert SQL data types to appropriate Notion property types
   - Select appropriate display formats for numbers, dates, etc.

3. **Create Primary Databases**
   - Start with core entities
   - Configure basic properties first

4. **Establish Relations**
   - Add relation properties between databases
   - Configure self-relations where needed

5. **Add Computed Properties**
   - Implement rollups for aggregations
   - Add formulas for calculated fields

6. **Optimize with Views**
   - Create relevant filtered/sorted views
   - Design views for common use cases

7. **Test Relationships**
   - Create sample entries
   - Verify relation bidirectionality
   - Test rollup calculations

8. **Document Database Structure**
