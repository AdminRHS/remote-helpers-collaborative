based on the guide on "how to create a google sheet for lead generation" I need to create a landing page further with the gamified elements of learning (to make teaching easier) ex. memory (cards) that need to be found in pairs, labyrinth where the core points are steps from the guide and wrong points (generated to mix the user) leads to the character death and force him to start from scratch to remember the material. And one more game is a drag-n-drop pipelines where you put elements in the right order to receive needed result (if the order is incorrect then element should fall apart again into wrong places for user to start again). Use the attached mascot. Follow the rules and structure from the attached file.

Updated Landing Page Structure with Puzzle Collection for Mary
This structure builds on the previous design, replacing badges with a puzzle collection mechanic. Each game, when completed correctly, awards a puzzle piece that assembles a new feature for Mary (e.g., a pretty hat, a piece of meat to eat). These features boost Mary’s "experience," visually enhancing her and unlocking a "Next Lessons" section to encourage further learning. The design retains the dark mode toggle, vibrant colors (electric purple, neon teal, fiery orange, lime green), and Mary as the central mascot, tailored for Replit AI visualization.

Overall Design Principles
Color Palette:
Dark Mode Base: Deep charcoal (#1A1A1A)
Light Mode Base: Soft off-white (#F5F5F5)
Vibrant Accents: Electric purple (#9B59B6), neon teal (#00FFFF), fiery orange (#FF5733), lime green (#32CD32)
Mascot Progression: Mary starts in her base form (light blue shirt, name tag). Completing each game adds a puzzle piece, assembling a new feature (e.g., a hat after Game 1, meat after Game 2, a scarf after Game 3), visually upgrading her.
Reward Mechanic: Each feature boosts Mary’s "experience" (e.g., a progress bar fills), encouraging users to continue learning.
Font: Poppins for a modern, friendly vibe.
Content Blocks and Interactive Views with Mary’s Puzzle Collection
1. Hero Section: Welcome and Introduction
Purpose: Introduce the journey with Mary and the puzzle collection goal.

Background: Dark mode - starry night with neon streaks (teal/orange); Light mode - off-white to lime green gradient with floating triangles.
Toggle: Sun/moon switch in the top-right corner, glowing faintly.
Visual Notes for Replit AI:
"Design a hero section with Mary pointing at the headline, waving on load, and a teal puzzle piece floating above her. Use a dark mode starry background with teal/orange streaks, light mode off-white/lime gradient with triangles, and a glowing purple ‘Dive In’ button. Add a sun/moon toggle."

Landing Page Flow and Visualization Tips
Flow: Hero → How It Works → Game 1 → Game 2 → Game 3 → Summary → Next Lessons → Footer. Use vibrant scroll animations (e.g., sections fade in with color bursts).
Dark Mode: Toggle switches to charcoal with neon accents; light mode uses off-white with bright overlays.
Mary’s Progression: Mary starts in her base form, gaining a hat (Game 1), meat (Game 2), and scarf (Game 3), each tied to a puzzle piece collection, visually enhancing her and motivating users.
Replit AI Prompt Example: "Build a landing page with a dark mode toggle (charcoal base, neon purple/teal/orange accents) and light mode (off-white, lime green shapes). Include a hero with Mary pointing, flip-card overview with Mary holding a puzzle piece, memory match grid (orange frames) with Mary cheering and gaining a hat, maze with Mary navigating and eating meat, formula drag-and-drop (teal pipeline) with Mary gaining a scarf, summary with upgraded Mary, lesson cards with Mary pointing, and glowing footer links.
