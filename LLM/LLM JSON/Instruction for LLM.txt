Instruction for LLM
1. What is LLM?
LLM (Large Language Model) is an AI-powered system used in our CRM to define and manage professions, objects related to those professions, task templates within them, and tools required to handle those task templates. It allows us to efficiently organize professions and automate processes related to task management.
In our system, we use LLM to:
	•	Define or create professions (e.g., 3D Designer).
	•	Assign objects, task templates, actions, and tools to each profession.
2. Structure of LLM in Our System
The structure used in our CRM follows a specific hierarchy:
	•	Profession: The role or job that needs to be defined or already exists (e.g., 3D Designer).
	•	Objects: Tangible or slightly abstract nouns (e.g., structures, textures, meshes) that the profession interacts with.
	•	task templates: Actions the profession can perform on objects, always formatted as "verb + object" (e.g., model structures, texture structures).
	•	Actions: The verb from the task template (e.g., "model" from "model structures").
	•	Tools: The instruments or software used by the profession to handle the task templates. Some tools are predefined, while others are dynamically generated by ChatGPT based on the context.
3. Key Components of LLM
Each profession, object, task template, action, and tool in our system has a specific meaning:
	•	Profession: The primary job role or title that the system manages (e.g., 3D Designer).
	•	Objects: Plural, lowercase, one-word tangible or slightly abstract entities that professions work with or on. In rare cases, objects can be two words (e.g., for a 3D Designer: structures, textures, meshes, renders, environments).
	•	task template: A specific task or duty the profession performs on the object, always structured as "verb + object" (e.g., model structures, texture structures, create renders).
	•	Action: The verb part of the task template, representing the action the profession performs (e.g., "model" from "model structures").
	•	Tools: The instruments or applications a profession uses to carry out its task templates (e.g., software used to create renders, modify meshes).
4. Definitions for Each Component
	•	Profession: A profession is defined either from a pre-existing list or is introduced by HR or recruiters when they require a new job role to be added. Each profession has its own set of objects, task templates, actions, and tools.
	•	Objects: These are entities a profession can work with or on. Objects are plural, concrete nouns that are typically tangible, but can also represent slightly abstract ideas. For example, a 3D Designer might interact with objects like structures, textures, meshes, renders, and environments.
	•	task templates: These define the tasks that the profession performs on the objects, always structured as "action (verb) + object (noun)." For example, a 3D Designer might have task templates like "model structures," "texture meshes," or "create renders."
	•	Actions: These are derived from task templates and are the verb portion, indicating the specific task the profession performs. In the case of "model structures," the action would be "model."
	•	Tools: Tools represent the software or instruments the profession uses to handle their task templates. While certain base tools are predefined for each profession, other tools can be generated dynamically by LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to fit the specific task templates.
5. Relationships and Nesting Between Components
In our system, components are interconnected in the following ways:
	•	Professions are the primary entity. They contain multiple Objects, which the profession interacts with or works on.
	•	Each Object is linked to one or more task templates, specifying the tasks that need to be performed on the objects.
	•	Actions are extracted from the task templates and represent the verbs that describe what needs to be done.
	•	Tools are then assigned to handle the task templates and actions. A profession can use multiple tools to complete its tasks, and ChatGPT can suggest new tools based on the actions and task templates.
Example Workflow: For a 3D Designer profession:
	•	Objects: structures, textures, meshes
	•	task templates: model structures, texture structures, create renders
	•	Actions: model, texture, create
	•	Tools: Blender (for 3D modelling), Photoshop (for textures), ChatGPT suggests new rendering tools
