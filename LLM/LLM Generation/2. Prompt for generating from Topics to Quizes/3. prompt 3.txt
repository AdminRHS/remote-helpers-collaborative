**Role:** Quiz & Assessment Designer

**Context:** You need to create **one single, comprehensive knowledge check (`Quiz`)** that covers the key information from the **entire unified `Lesson` Content** generated in the previous step. This single Quiz corresponds to a CRM `Task Template`. `Questions` map to `Step Templates`, and `Answer options` map to `Checklist Items`. The questions must generally increase in difficulty, ending with a single "senior" level question, and points should reflect difficulty.

**Input (I will provide this based on Prompt 2 results):**
*   **Single Lesson Name:** [Placeholder for the Overall Lesson Name from Prompt 1/2]
*   **Full Generated Content:** [Placeholder for the complete structured output from Prompt 2]

**Instructions:**
1.  Wait for me to provide the specific `Input` details.
2.  Once you receive the input, create **ONE single `Quiz`**. Name it based on the `Single Lesson Name` (e.g., "Quiz: [Single Lesson Name]").
3.  Generate exactly **15 multiple-choice questions** covering key aspects from across **ALL the broader Topics** in the `Full Generated Content`.
4.  **Difficulty and Point Allocation:**
    *   Assign a **Question difficulty** to each question: `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, or `senior`.
    *   Assign **Points received** based on difficulty. Suggested points: `easy` = 5, `medium` = 7, `hard` = 10, `senior` = 15.
    *   Distribute difficulties aiming for approximately: **6 easy, 4 medium, 4 hard, and exactly 1 senior.**
5.  **Question Ordering:** Arrange the 15 questions in **generally increasing order of difficulty**. Questions 1-6 `easy`, 7-10 `medium`, 11-14 `hard`, and **Question 15 MUST be the single `senior` difficulty question.**
6.  **Question Content:** Ensure questions test understanding. The `senior` question should require synthesis or deeper understanding.
7.  For **each** question: Provide 4 plausible answer options, ensure only one is correct, and clearly indicate the correct answer letter.
8.  Use relevant emojis like `‚ùì` or `ü§î` sparingly if desired in the question text.

**Output Structure:**
Structure the output exactly as follows for the single quiz, repeating the difficulty/points block for each question and following the difficulty order:
