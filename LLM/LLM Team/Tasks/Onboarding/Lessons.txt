In the first lesson, we will focus on preparing your workspace, which is an important step for effective teamwork. You will learn how to properly set up Dropbox and Cursor with auto-save, create a project folder hierarchy, and use file naming templates. We will also cover the installation and setup of Discord to ensure fast and efficient team communication. These tools and processes will help you organize your workspace, which will significantly simplify project management and interaction with colleagues.

Auto-saving files is critically important for teamwork. Proper setup prevents data loss and ensures synchronization between participants.

System setup:

- Install Dropbox ([dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com))
- Grant all necessary permissions, make sure files are syncing.
- Log in using [admin@rh-s.com](mailto:admin@rh-s.com) account
- Install Cursor, open Settings → General → Appearance → Open Editor Settings → select auto-save type with regular interval, on focus change, and so on.
- Enable auto-save
- Specify Dropbox folder
- Test the setup with a sample file

After setup, all changes will automatically sync through Dropbox with the entire team.

## Lesson 2: Activating Yolo Mode

Yolo Mode is the mode in Cursor IDE that gives the rights to edit files on your computer. To activate it and configure automatic features, perform the following steps:

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to Settings
3. Navigate to the Features tab
4. Find and check the "Enable auto-run mode" checkbox to allow the agent to automatically execute tools without confirmation prompts
5. In the Editor section, enable "Auto select for Ctrl/$ + K" for automatic region selection
6. Under Auto-run Prompt, enable "Iterate on lints" for automatic lint error fixes
7. In the Cursor Tab section, turn on "Auto Import (for TypeScript)"
8. In the Chat section, enable:
    - Auto-scroll to bottom
    - Auto-apply to files outside context in edit mode
9. Click Apply or Save to confirm the changes

After enabling these settings, the agent will be able to run tools automatically and perform various automated actions without requesting confirmation each time.

Deep Research is a powerful feature in modern AI tools that allows for comprehensive information gathering and analysis. Here's how to effectively use different AI tools for deep research:
