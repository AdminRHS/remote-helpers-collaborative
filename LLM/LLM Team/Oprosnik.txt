This distribution reflects the relative importance of technical knowledge (30%) and cognitive skills (25%), with personality 
and practical tasks having lower weightages. However, for professions where practical skills are paramount, such as front-end 
development, the 10% weightage for practical tasks might be reconsidered, as suggested by [4 Common Assessment Types and When 
to Use Them](https://wonderlic.com/blog/assessments/4-common-assessment-types-and-when-to-use-them/).

#### Recommendation System
The recommendation system matches candidates to professions based on their normalized scores relative to the required skill 
profile for each role. For example, a candidate excelling in analytical thinking and CRM tools might be recommended as a 
Sales Manager first, followed by PPC Specialist or Financial Manager, as per the user's example. This approach ensures a 
personalized fit, aligning with [Your Guide to the Types of Hiring Assessments | Harver](https://harver.com/blog/guide-to-hiring-assessments).

#### Development Process
