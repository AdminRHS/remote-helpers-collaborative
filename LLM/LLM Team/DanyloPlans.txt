Day 1:
Objective: Refine and process the General Plans file for further development, explore gamification platforms, and identify tools for website snapshots.

    1. Run the General Plans file through DeeperSearch again.
        Reprocess the file to make it more detailed, addressing the issue from last Friday when errors occurred (possibly due to character limits).
        Check the character count beforehand and split the file into smaller sections if needed to avoid hitting limits.
        Save the output as a new version (e.g., "General_Plans_v2").
    2. Feed the updated General Plans file into the Cursor program via an AI model.
        Upload the DeeperSearch output into Cursor.
        Ensure the AI model integrates the file correctly and troubleshoot any formatting issues.
    3. Assign employees to each Step in General Plans using Cursor’s AI.
        For each Step, analyze required skills and match them to an employee with relevant expertise.
        Add one employee per Step, documenting their name and a brief justification (e.g., "John – skilled in UI design").
        Export the updated file with assignments as "General_Plans".
    4. Find platforms similar to Habitica.com.
        Search for platforms that gamify task management or habit tracking, like Habitica, with features such as character creation, rewards (e.g., coins), and customizable 
        profiles.
        Evaluate at least 3–5 alternatives (e.g., TaskHero, Do It Now: RPG To Do List) for their core features and potential CRM inspiration.
        Compile a short list with brief notes on their gamification elements and usability for reference later in the week.
    5. Identify the focus of platforms capable of taking snapshots of preferred websites.
        Research tools or platforms that automate website screenshot creation, focusing on their ability to capture full pages or specific sections.
        Explore options like Greenshot, URL2PNG, or browser extensions (e.g., GoFullPage) for ease of use and integration potential.
        Note their key functionalities (e.g., annotation, cloud storage, API access) and assess relevance for CRM or project documentation needs.
    6. Sort the obtained information on gamification into different folders and process it through in-depth AI analysis.

Day 2:
Objective: Develop and implement a new structure for managing professions, objects, actions, task templates, and tools using the LLM10 model.

    1. Creating LLM7, that combine LLM6-LLM9 to new LLM10 and delete dublicates using 2 python codes
    2. Using LLM10 - help to make new profession by this structure
    3. Create a prompt that can generate tables for LLM10.

Day 3:
Objective: To efficiently generate and manage structured data and educational content through automation and LLM-assisted workflows.
    1. After successfully creating a prompt to generate tables in TSV format for a specified company and department, both ChatGPT and Grok were able to generate tables in the desired format. Therefore, I will proceed to generate new tables for all required companies.
    2. Create an LLM10.json file using spreadsheets and the Gemini thinking model within Cursor.
    3. Automate the creation of a new profession definition using Cursor. This will involve generating a prompt file and a separate instruction file outlining the steps to achieve the desired outcome.
    4. In the "How to Work" course on Replit, edit the markdown file to enhance detail and include a warning. Additionally, transfer the content of Day 1 from the LinkedIn course into the "How to Work" course as a second block, effectively restructuring the LinkedIn course to a 4-day format.

Day 4:
Objective: To explore and implement self-learning AI models and automate the creation of educational content.
    1. Conduct an in-depth study to set up a Self-Learning AI model on our server.
    2. Gather all relevant information and upload it to Cursor, including a guide on how to install the AI.
    3. Generate a prompt for the automatic creation of guides and tutorials based on JSON LLM output and other relevant information.

Day 5:
Objective: To optimize the educational content creation process by improving prompts and implementing gamification elements.
    1. Test the prompt, and if it doesn't work, transform it into a prompt chain, where: 
        a. the first generates topics
        b. the second generates subtopics and content
        c. the third generates a quiz
    2. Add difficulty levels and points (gamification) to the quiz.
    3. Unplanned: gathered in a voice channel with 13 people and discussed how to make the course more gamified.
